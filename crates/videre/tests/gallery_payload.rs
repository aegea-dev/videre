//! A gallery page must not carry the whole library.
//!
//! :warning: **This is the test that would have caught three shipped faults, all
//! of which passed every test that existed.**
//!
//! 0.18.0 shipped `videre gallery` inlining its entire dataset. On a real
//! 70,601-file library that produced a **149 MB page** which no browser could
//! open: 145 MB of base64 embeddings, plus a face crop decoded from the original
//! for every labelled face, plus every file as JSON. The server built it in
//! 0.74s, so nothing anywhere reported a problem. It simply never appeared.
//!
//! Two of the three were fixed in 0.20.2. The third is the file list.
//!
//! **Why nothing caught them:** every other fixture in this suite holds between
//! one and four files, and `gallery_routes.rs` asserts that a page *renders*. A
//! page that takes an hour still renders. Reproducing the worst of them needed
//! faces, at scale, on slow storage; a synthetic library with the right file
//! count and no faces confirmed the wrong fix entirely.
//!
//! So this asserts a **byte ceiling**, which is the one assertion that catches
//! the whole class rather than the three instances.
//!
//! :warning: **The fixture uses real decodable JPEGs on purpose.** If a
//! regression reintroduced inline face crops, `face_thumb_b64` would silently
//! return `None` for a stub file and the page would stay small, passing this
//! test while being broken. The crops have to be producible for their absence to
//! mean anything.
