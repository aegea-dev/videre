//! `videre gallery`: one local server for browsing a library.
//!
//! Every view is a route rather than a flag, so moving between them is a link
//! rather than a second command. That is only possible with a live backend:
//! face click-through and reverse-geocoded place names both need one, which is
//! why the old `report --faces` and `report --show-faces` were servers while
//! the other modes wrote files.
//!
//! Rendering a set a command just produced is the other half, and stays static:
//! see `dedupe review` and `search --html`.
