//! Library-scoped settings: the type, its built-in defaults, and the
//! `config.toml` under the library's reserved state directory.
//!
//! `db` and `jsonl` are fixed declarations, not relocation settings: if
//! present they must equal the exact filenames the paths layer already
//! derives, so a config copied from another library can never redirect a
//! process into that library. A missing file means the defaults and creates
//! nothing; a file that fails validation, or does not parse, is an error
//! rather than a silent fallback, because a typo in the config must surface,
//! not vanish. Unknown keys (including nested tables) are preserved by
//! edits, which rewrite by renaming a synced scratch file into place. The
//! bounded worker prepares only the scratch file; publication happens after
//! that worker returns, so an I/O failure or timeout leaves prior bytes
//! unchanged and cannot publish stale settings later.
