title: videre export
description: Write videre's labels (face regions, location, categories, ratings) to portable .xmp sidecars.
---

Writes the labels you built in videre into standard `.xmp` sidecar files next to
your photos, so other tools (digiKam, Lightroom, darktable) can read them. This
is how videre stops being an island: the work you invested in naming faces,
rating and labelling travels with your library instead of living only in
`hashes.db`.

Opt-in and non-custodial: it only ever writes a `.xmp` sidecar beside the file,
and never modifies the original.

```bash
videre export --xmp                          # every file with something to write
videre export --xmp --path 2024              # just one subfolder
videre export --xmp --person "Ayşe"          # just photos of one person
videre export --xmp --dry-run                # list what would be written
videre export --jsonl                        # snapshot the scan inventory to .videre/hashes.jsonl
```

## JSONL snapshot

`videre export --jsonl` writes one JSON object per file to
`.videre/hashes.jsonl`, replacing any previous snapshot atomically. It is the
composability handoff: one line per file straight into `jq`, `awk` or a
spreadsheet, with no SQLite dependency. See
[JSONL output](/guides/jsonl/) for the format and what it leaves out. `--xmp`
and `--jsonl` are mutually exclusive, and it is a scan-inventory snapshot, not
an annotations or embeddings backup.

## What it writes

For each selected photo, videre writes the labels it owns into one sidecar,
using the standard fields the other tools already read:

| videre data | XMP field |
|---|---|
| Named faces (confirmed) | MWG face regions (`mwg-rs:Regions`), name plus box |
| Resolved location name | `Iptc4xmpCore:Location` |
| [Tags](/commands/tag/) | `dc:subject` keywords |
| Star rating | `xmp:Rating` |
| Colour label | `xmp:Label` |

Face regions are written as normalized MWG areas, the format digiKam and
Lightroom use for face tags, so a name you assigned in videre shows up as a named
face region there. Picks and likes have no portable standard and stay in videre's
database.

The category [`videre classify`](/commands/classify/) gives a photo is not
exported either. It is recomputed whenever you classify again, and a scan reads
every `dc:subject` keyword back as a tag, so writing it there would turn it into
a tag you never added. Versions before 0.50.0 did write it: the next full
export rewrites the keywords from your tags alone, so the old category keyword
disappears from the sidecar, while keywords another app added stay, because
scan has already imported them as tags.

A file with nothing to write gets no sidecar. If it already has one, videre's
fields are removed from it, so a label you took away since the last export does
not linger there.

## Merging, not clobbering

If a sidecar already exists (for example one Lightroom wrote), videre **merges**:
it replaces only the fields it owns and preserves everything else in the file
verbatim, including another tool's keywords and develop settings. Re-exporting is
safe and idempotent.

## Choosing what to export

The selection flags narrow the library exactly as [`videre search`](/commands/search/)
does: `--path`, `--person`, `--date`/`--after`/`--before`,
`--location`/`--radius`, `--type`, `--ext`, `--mime`, `--category`, `--has`,
`--missing`, and the mark/tag filters `--rating`, `--pick`, `--label`,
`--like`, `--tag`, and `--query` for OR and NOT (a
[query](/reference/query-syntax/), filters only). See
[scoping a run](/guides/scoping-a-run/). With no selection, every file with
something to write gets a sidecar.

A run prints `N of M`, so a filter matching nothing is distinguishable from an
empty library.

## Options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--xmp` | Write XMP sidecars (the only export format; required) |
| `--dry-run` | List the sidecars that would be written, write nothing |
| `--library <dir>` | Select a different library instead of the [current directory](/commands/config/) |
| `--silent` | Suppress the summary line |

## Reading it back

videre reads standard XMP on [`videre scan`](/commands/scan/), so labels other
tools wrote can come back into videre too. The `--xmp` precedence rule (which side
wins) is documented on the [scan](/commands/scan/) page. Continuous export while
you work in another tool is available as an opt-in [`watch`](/commands/watch/)
stage.
