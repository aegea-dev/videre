title: videre tag
description: Add or remove free-form tags on photos, then find them with search --tag.
---

Tags a photo with any word or phrase you like. Tags are stored per photo (by
content hash, so they follow a photo across duplicates and moves) and compose
with every other filter in [`videre search`](/commands/search/).

```bash
videre tag --add beach --add summer --path ~/Photos/2024   # add on a selection
videre tag --add "to print" --person "Ayşe" --rating 5      # target by any filter
videre tag --remove beach --path ~/Photos/2024/blurry       # remove
```

## Setting tags

Give at least one `--add` or `--remove` (both are repeatable, and you may pass
both in one run: removals apply first, then additions).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--add <tag>` | Add this tag to every file in the selection |
| `--remove <tag>` | Remove this tag from every file in the selection |

The gallery tags and untags many photos at once: see
[Selecting](/commands/gallery/#selecting).

## Choosing what to tag

The selection flags narrow the library the same way `search` does: `--person`,
`--category`, `--date`/`--after`/`--before`, `--location`/`--radius`, `--type`,
`--ext`, `--mime`, `--path`, `--has`, `--missing`, plus the mark and tag
filters `--rating`, `--pick`, `--label`, `--like` and `--tag`, and `--query`
for OR and NOT (a [query](/reference/query-syntax/), filters only:
`videre tag --query 'person:özgür OR person:ayşe' --add aile`). See
[scoping a run](/guides/scoping-a-run/). A run prints `N of M`. With no
selection, every file is tagged.

`--add`/`--remove` are the setters; `--tag` is a *filter* here, narrowing which
files are (un)tagged to those that already carry it. The two never collide
because they use different flags: `videre tag --add printed --tag beach` adds
`printed` only to files already tagged `beach`.

## Removing tags

`--remove` takes the tag by name and removes it from every file in the
selection; files that do not carry it are left alone.

```bash
videre tag --remove beach --path ~/Photos/2024/blurry   # from one folder
videre tag --remove beach                               # from the whole library
videre tag --remove "to print" --remove draft           # several at once
```

To rename a tag everywhere, scope the addition to files that carry the old one:
`videre tag --tag beach --remove beach --add seaside`. There is no flag that
removes every tag from a file at once; name each tag with `--remove`.

## Finding photos by tag

`--tag` is a filter on [`videre search`](/commands/search/), composing with
everything else. It is repeatable and ANDed: every named tag must be present.

```bash
videre search --tag beach
videre search --tag beach --tag summer --person "Ayşe" --rating 4
```

## Portability

Tags round-trip through standard XMP `dc:subject` keywords: a scan reads keywords
from a photo's sidecar or embedded packet and stores them as tags, and
[`videre export --xmp`](/commands/export/) writes your tags, and only your
tags, back out as `dc:subject`, so digiKam, Lightroom and darktable see them.
Hierarchical keywords (`lr:hierarchicalSubject`) are not modelled; a tag
is one flat string, and a `/`-separated value is stored verbatim.

Before 0.50.0, export also wrote each photo's [category](/commands/classify/)
as a keyword, so a library rebuilt from those sidecars has tags such as
`photo` and `unknown` that you never added. videre cannot tell them from tags
you chose, so remove them yourself, once:

```bash
videre tag --remove photo --remove screenshot --remove document --remove meme --remove unknown
videre export --xmp    # rewrite the sidecars without them
```

## Other options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--library <dir>` | Select a different library instead of the [current directory](/commands/config/) |
| `--silent` | Suppress the `N of M` line |
