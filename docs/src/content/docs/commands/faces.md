---

Detects faces, then groups them so you can name a person once instead of tagging
each photo.

```bash
videre faces                           # detect, group, and store (resumable)
videre faces --limit 500               # only process 500 new images, then stop
videre faces --recluster               # regroup unassigned faces without re-detecting
videre faces --reset                   # wipe all face state and start over (asks first)
videre faces --dry-run                 # detect but write nothing
videre faces --profile                 # print per-stage timing when finished
videre faces --silent                  # no per-image progress
videre --library ~/Photos faces        # select a different library
videre faces --ext heic                # only HEIC photos
videre faces --date 2024-07            # only that month
```

These filters work the same way across commands, and combine. See
[scoping a run](/guides/scoping-a-run/).
:::

The first run downloads about 180 MB, separate from the search model.

## The whole workflow

Detection and naming are separate steps. The first is slow and automatic, the
second is fast and manual.

```bash
videre faces                  # 1. find faces and group them (slow, resumable)
videre gallery         # 2. name the groups in your browser
videre search --person "Alice"
```

Step 2 opens `localhost:7878`; naming happens on its **People** tab
(`/people`), which has three sections: **People** you have named, **Unassigned
Clusters** (groups it is confident about but has no name for), and **Singletons**
(faces it could not group). Drag a cluster onto a person to assign it, or create
a new person from it.

Clicking a cluster or a person opens its own page, at `/people/cluster/<id>` and
`/people/person/<name>`.

The payoff is the ratio: one drag can name forty photos.

### Working through a large library

Detection on tens of thousands of photos takes hours. `--limit` lets you do it
in sittings:

```bash
videre faces --limit 2000     # a chunk, then stop
videre faces --limit 2000     # continue where it left off
videre faces --recluster      # once, after the last chunk
```

A limited run **skips the grouping step**, because grouping is a whole-library
pass that is not worth repeating after every chunk. Run `--recluster` once at
the end, or grouping never happens at all.

Plain `videre faces` with no `--limit` does group at the end, so if you are
happy to let it run to completion you never need `--recluster`.

## Fixing bad grouping

Grouping is the part that needs judgement, and `--recluster` makes experimenting
cheap: it reuses existing detections, so it takes minutes rather than hours.

```bash
videre faces --recluster --eps 0.55            # stricter: fewer, tighter groups
videre faces --recluster --merge-sim 0.30      # more willing to merge groups
videre faces --recluster --min-cluster-size 2  # allow smaller groups
```

**Labeled people are never moved.** Reclustering regroups only the faces you
have not named. A face you assigned to a person keeps its name and its person
page exactly as it is, whatever tuning flags you pass, so experimenting is
safe.

## Evaluate grouping quality

If you have named some faces, `--evaluate` can measure how the current grouping
parameters reproduce those confirmed labels:

```bash
videre faces --evaluate
videre faces --evaluate --json
videre faces --evaluate --eps 0.55 --min-cluster-size 3 --json
```

Confirmed labels act as ground truth only for this report. Evaluation replays
the selected grouping parameters over every stored face embedding in memory,
including labeled faces, then compares the temporary groups with the labels. It
does not detect faces, load or download models, migrate the database, or write
group assignments. The groups and labels stored in your library stay unchanged.

The report includes:

- **Pair precision:** among pairs placed in the same group, the share with the
  same confirmed identity.
- **Pair recall:** among pairs with the same confirmed identity, the share
  placed in the same group.
- **Mixed clusters:** groups containing more than one confirmed identity.
- **Fragmented identities:** confirmed identities spread across more than one
  group or the unassigned outcome.
- **Unassigned rate:** the share of labeled faces left outside a group.

When a denominator does not exist, such as pair metrics for one labeled face,
the human report says `n/a` and JSON uses `null`. Current videre does not
suggest person labels, so suggestion coverage is zero and the JSON
`suggestions` field is `null` rather than a fabricated score.

Evaluation always covers the complete labeled library, so it rejects selection
flags such as `--date`, `--path`, and `--tag`. JSON output contains aggregate
measurements and selected parameters only. It intentionally excludes paths,
hashes, person names, face ids, and embeddings.

## Your labels are frozen

Assigning a face to a person freezes it. Clustering, `--recluster`, watch, and
every other automatic process leave labeled faces exactly as they are. You
remove a label in the gallery's People tab, or wipe everything at once with
`videre faces --reset`. Removing a person returns their faces to the
unassigned pool and reopens the grouping pass, so the next `--recluster` (or
watch's maintenance pass) regroups them fresh.

| Symptom | Try |
|---|---|
| One person split across several groups | Lower `--merge-sim` toward 0.30 |
| Two people merged into one group | Raise `--merge-sim`, or lower `--eps` |
| Too many singletons, few groups | Lower `--min-cluster-size` to 2 |
| A group full of unrelated faces | Raise `--min-face-size`, lower `--max-generic-sim` |

:::note[Two people should not merge in the first place]
Merging two groups now requires more than similar averages: they must also be
close *overall*, not merely pointing the same way. Two tight groups that sit far
apart are refused however similar their averages look.

This was added after two different people ended up in one group on a real
library, at an average similarity of 0.370 against a threshold of 0.35. If you
hit that on an older version, `--merge-sim` is still the knob - raise it - but
you should need it far less often now.
:::

Change one value at a time and look at the result. These interact, and a
combination that fixes one library often overfits it.

For a single wrongly-merged group, the labeling UI's **Dissolve cluster** button
is better than retuning: it breaks that group back into singletons without
touching anything else. Faces are not deleted.

### All tuning options

```bash
videre faces --eps 0.6                 # how alike faces must be to group (default 0.6)
videre faces --min-cluster-size 3      # fewest faces that can form a group (default 3)
videre faces --merge-sim 0.35          # how readily two groups merge (default 0.35)
videre faces --min-face-size 80        # ignore faces smaller than this in pixels (default 80)
videre faces --min-blur 80             # ignore faces too soft to read (default 80)
videre faces --max-landmark-error 7    # ignore faces the detector mislocated (default 7)
videre faces --max-generic-sim 0.4     # legacy fallback, see below (default 0.4)
videre faces --attach-sim 0.4          # stray faces join their nearest group (default 0.4)
videre faces --batch 8                 # images per batch (default 8)
videre faces --workers 8               # parallel workers (default: 2x your CPU cores)
videre faces --qlmanage-concurrency 6  # simultaneous HEIC conversions, shared by every videre process (default 6)
```

### Clustering parameters

The eight grouping values above (`--eps` through `--attach-sim`) can also be
tuned from the gallery: the People page's **Recluster** control previews and
applies them without leaving the page, and saves what differs from the
defaults to the library's `.videre/gallery.json`. From then on each value
comes from, in order:

| run | first | then | then |
|---|---|---|---|
| `videre faces` (a detection run, `--recluster`, or `videre pipeline`) | its flag, when given | `gallery.json` | the default |
| [`videre watch`](/commands/watch/)'s grouping pass | `gallery.json` | the default | |

Per value: a saved `eps` changes only `eps`. When `gallery.json` supplies
anything, the run says so in one line, and names a flag that overrode it:

```
Clustering with gallery settings: eps 0.7, min_cluster_size 2 (from .videre/gallery.json)
Clustering flags override gallery settings: eps 0.65 (gallery.json has 0.7)
```

`--silent` keeps the line out of the terminal (it still reaches the log at the
`info` level). A flag never changes `gallery.json`; to keep a value, apply it
from the gallery. A `gallery.json` that cannot be read, or a value of the
wrong type or out of range, is reported and the default is used instead, so a
typo there never stops a faces run.

## Why some faces are ignored

Before grouping, low-quality faces are held out. They come back as unassigned
singletons, still visible and still nameable by hand, just not grouped.

This exists because low-quality faces produce near-identical featureless
fingerprints regardless of who they are, so grouping them piles unrelated people
into one large mixed cluster. A face is held out if it fails any check:

- **Size** (`--min-face-size`, default 80px). Tiny crops, such as distant faces
  in group shots, are mostly blur once scaled up.
- **Sharpness** (`--min-blur`, default 80). The variance of the Laplacian of the
  aligned crop, which is the image the model is actually given. Measured on a
  1,063-face library: faces that grouped had a median of 894, faces left ungrouped
  182.
- **Alignment** (`--max-landmark-error`, default 7). The model never sees your
  photo, only a small square built by warping it so the detected eyes, nose and
  mouth land on fixed positions. When the detector mislocates those points the
  square is a mangled image, and the fingerprint describes the mangling rather
  than the person, so such faces resemble *each other*. This measures how far the
  five points are from being a face shape at all.

Each is disabled by setting it to 0, except `--max-landmark-error`, which is
disabled by setting it high.

:warning: **`--max-generic-sim` (default 0.4) is a fallback, and only applies to
faces recorded before sharpness was measured.** It compares a face against the
average of every face in the library, which sounds reasonable and is not: on a
personal library that average largely *is* the most photographed person, so the
check discards the very faces most worth grouping. Measured on a labelled
library, it blocked 15 photos of the owner, several of which matched a face
already in their group almost exactly. Run `videre faces --reset` to record
sharpness and leave it behind.

## When a photo is deleted

When `videre prune` removes the last indexed copy of a photo, its detected
faces disappear from People, but the person's name remains. If the last face
of a person was on that photo, the person can be labeled again later without
recovering the deleted photo.

## Reset

`videre faces --reset` is the start-over button. It deletes every face row,
every person you have named, the detection markers, and the decode-failure
records, then immediately re-runs the full detection and grouping pipeline, so
the library ends up exactly as it would after a first-ever `videre faces`.

Because it deletes your labels, it asks first. The prompt shows the counts of
face rows, labeled faces and people that it would delete:

```bash
videre faces --reset            # asks: "deletes 400 face row(s) (312 labeled
                                # face(s) across 9 people), ... Continue? [y/N]"
videre faces --reset --yes      # skip the prompt (for scripts)
```

In a non-interactive session (a script without a terminal, a cron job), reset
refuses rather than wipe unseen: rerun with `--yes` after reading the counts.
`--dry-run` shows the counts and deletes nothing.

A reset is always whole-library. It cannot be combined with `--recluster` or
`--limit`, and selection flags are refused: wiping everything and rebuilding
only part of it is never what those combinations would deliver.

If faces has never run on the library there is nothing to reset, and reset
says so and exits. Libraries whose face rows predate the detection markers
reset normally.

### Recovering more of one person

`--attach-sim` (default 0.4) runs a second pass after grouping: an ungrouped
face joins the group holding its **nearest** face, if that face is at least this
similar. Grouping normally asks a face to resemble the *average* of a whole
group, which someone photographed over many years can fail even when three
members match them almost exactly. Lower it to recover more, raise it (or set
it to 1) to turn the pass off.

It runs after grouping and can never merge two groups, which is what keeps it
safe.

## Why grouping runs in two stages

Average-linkage grouping alone fragments one person into several groups, because
one person's photos legitimately spread wide (pose, lighting, age). A second
pass then merges any two established groups whose averaged fingerprints are at
least `--merge-sim` alike.

Deciding on averages rather than individual faces is what makes this safe: on
real data, confirmed *different* people never exceeded about 0.29, while one
person's fragments ran 0.37 to 0.76. Only established groups take part, never
lone singletons: a single bad crop can resemble a different person, whereas a
whole group's average cannot.

## Caveats

:::caution[Do not run two heavy commands at once]
`faces`, [`embed`](/commands/embed/), and [`watch`](/commands/watch/) all convert
HEIC through the same macOS service, and each limits itself independently, so
together they overwhelm it.

Measured with `faces` and `embed` running together: a HEIC load averaged over 16
seconds against about 7.6 uncontended, and one file exceeded the timeout that
converted in 0.39 s on its own. A file that times out is not lost: it rests
for a day at most, then is tried again by the next run or `watch`. But it is
much slower than running them one after the other.
:::

**Warm the HEIC cache first** if your library is HEIC-heavy. Detection reads
already-decoded images when they exist, about 108 ms against 7.6 s:

```bash
videre --library ~/Photos watch --heic     # then Ctrl-C once it settles
videre faces
```

See the [thumbnail cache](/guides/caches/#thumbnail-cache) for what that
stores and how much space it takes.

**Names live on faces, not on groups.** Group numbers are reassigned on every
`--recluster`, but the names you assigned are kept, because they are stored per
face. Retuning does not lose your work.

**An interrupt can cost more than one image.** Each worker batches, so a Ctrl-C
can lose up to `workers x batch` images of progress, which is 160 with the
defaults on a 10-core machine. Everything already committed is safe and the
rerun continues correctly; it just redoes a little.

**A file that fails to decode twice is skipped**, so it stops costing a timeout
on every run (and every `watch` cycle). A single failure never skips a file.
How long the skip lasts depends on why it failed: a file that is not a
decodable image is skipped for good, since only a change to the file could fix
it, and a changed file is a new one to videre. A timeout, an unreachable drive
or an unknown cause is skipped for a day, then tried again by itself, so a file
caught while QuickLook was busy gets its faces without you doing anything.
[`videre status`](/commands/status/) counts skipped files.
`videre faces --reset` clears these records too, along with everything else.

**A failing library volume stops the run.** An unreadable *file* is skipped as
above, and a drive whose files cannot be read at all keeps skipping them on
every run. What stops `videre faces` at the first failed write, with one
message instead of one error per photo, is a disk-level *write* failure: a
full disk, or a database gone read-only. Everything already committed is
safe; re-run when the drive is healthy and it continues.

**Detection is not perfect.** Faces in profile, heavily shadowed, or very small
are often missed entirely, and no amount of retuning brings them back, since
tuning only affects grouping of faces that were already found. `--reset`
re-detects from scratch, which only helps after a videre upgrade changes
detection itself.

**Nothing is uploaded.** Detection, grouping, and the naming UI all run locally.
The server on `localhost:7878` is reachable only from your machine.

## Performance

| Flag | Does |
|---|---|
| `--workers` | detection threads (default: twice your core count) |
| `--profile` | print per-stage timings: load, detect, align, embed, db write |

`--profile` is the quickest way to see whether a slow run is bound by decoding
or by inference. Why the default oversubscribes your cores, and the measured
4.48x it is worth, are in [tuning](/guides/tuning/#face-detection).

## Scoping the run

Every flag below narrows an existing set, never widens it, and they combine:
each condition must hold.

| Flag | Selects |
|---|---|
| `--type` | `image` or `video`. Repeatable, or comma-separated |
| `--ext` | file extension, e.g. `mov`. Repeatable, or comma-separated |
| `--mime` | exact type, e.g. `video/quicktime`. Repeatable, or comma-separated |
| `--after` | date on or after this (inclusive) |
| `--before` | date before this (exclusive) |
| `--date` | a whole year, month or day: `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `--location` | within `--radius` km of a place, e.g. `"Berlin, Germany"` |
| `--radius` | radius in km for `--location` (default 20) |
| `--path` | only files under this directory. Repeatable |
| `--has` | only files with this metadata. Supported fields: `gps`, `date` |
| `--missing` | only files missing this metadata. Supported fields: `gps`, `date` |
| `--rating` | only photos rated at least this many stars (0-5) |
| `--pick` | only photos with this pick state: `keep` or `reject` |
| `--label` | only photos with this colour label |
| `--like` | only liked photos |
| `--tag` | only files carrying this tag. Repeatable; all must be present |
| `--query` | only files matching a [query](/reference/query-syntax/), filters only, for OR and NOT: `'(tag:deniz OR tag:plaj) -tag:ekran'` |

`--person` and `--category` are deliberately absent: both are derived from data
this command produces, so selecting its input by one would be circular.

A scoped run prints `N of M`, so a filter that matches nothing is
distinguishable from an empty library. Full detail, including how missing data
excludes a file, is in [scoping a run](/guides/scoping-a-run/).

## Importing names from XMP

If a photo has an `.xmp` sidecar (or embedded XMP) with named face regions, for
example one digiKam or Lightroom wrote, `videre faces` reads those regions and
assigns the names to the faces it detects, matching each region to a face by
where it sits in the frame. This is the read side of
[`videre export --xmp`](/commands/export/): a name you gave a face in another
tool imports into videre.

Names are imported while faces are being detected, so the region has a detected
face to attach to. To import into a library whose faces were detected earlier,
re-run with `--reset`.

The `--xmp` flag decides who wins when both carry a name:

| `--xmp` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `db` (default) | The database wins: imported names fill only faces you have not already named |
| `file` | The sidecar wins: an imported name replaces an existing one |
| `newest` | Reserved; currently behaves as `db` |

The default comes from the `xmp_precedence` config key (see
[`videre config`](/commands/config/)), the same setting `scan` uses for ratings.

## Rotated photos

Photos stored rotated on disk (an EXIF orientation tag, common in exports and
edits) are decoded the way you see them before detection and grouping, so
sideways-stored files cluster exactly like upright ones. Files processed by
older videre versions were detected on the stored pixel canvas, which could
leave a person's own photos as unassigned singletons; re-run
`videre faces --reset` to bring a library current, and see
[troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting/) for the recovery recipes and
their costs.

## More detail

- [Long-running jobs](/guides/long-running-jobs/) covers running this alongside other commands, and resuming.
- [Caches and disk use](/guides/caches/) covers the decode cache this reads from.
- [Backing up](/guides/backup/) covers why the names you assign are the one thing that cannot be recomputed.
