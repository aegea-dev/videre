## Install script

One command, no Rust toolchain, nothing to compile:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh
```

It works out your platform, downloads the matching release, **verifies it
against the `.sha256` published with that release before unpacking it**, and
puts the binary in `~/.local/bin`. If that directory is not on your `PATH` it
prints the line to add. It never edits your shell profile.

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--version X.Y.Z` | Install a specific release rather than the latest |
| `--to DIR` | Install somewhere other than `~/.local/bin` |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the binary the script installed |
| `--help` | Show usage |

Pass options after `-s --`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh -s -- --version 0.20.1
```

:::note[`-s --` is the same in every shell]
Everything after the pipe is parsed by `sh`, not by the shell you typed the line
into, so `-s --` behaves identically in **fish, zsh and bash**. `-s` tells `sh`
to read the script from the pipe, and `--` ends `sh`'s own options so the rest
reach the installer.
:::

### Upgrading

Run the same command again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh
```

It fetches the newest release and **overwrites the binary in place**. There is
nothing to uninstall first, and your library, settings and downloaded models are
untouched. Check it took with `videre --version`.

:::caution[Nothing tells you an update exists]
The script never checks for one and videre does not phone home, so upgrading is
something you do rather than something you are prompted about. If you would
rather not think about it, [Homebrew](#homebrew) handles upgrades:
`brew upgrade videre`.
:::

Going back is the same command with a version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh -s -- --version 0.20.0
```

### Removing it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

This removes **one file**, the binary the script installed. Your library and
the downloaded models are left exactly where they are, and the script prints
both paths with their sizes so you can remove them yourself if you want to:

- `<library>/.videre/` holds the database, your config and the search embeddings. An
  embedding costs hours to recompute, so nothing here is deleted for you.
- `~/.cache/huggingface/` holds the models, and is shared with any other tool
  that uses the Hugging Face cache.

If the `videre` it finds was installed by Homebrew or `cargo`, the script
refuses to delete it and tells you the right command instead. Removing a
package manager's file behind its back leaves it believing videre is still
installed.

## Homebrew

**The best option on macOS**, because it handles upgrades:

```bash
brew install erhangundogan/tap/videre
```

## Prebuilt binary

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/erhangundogan/videre/releases/latest)
and put it on your `PATH`. No Rust toolchain needed, nothing to compile.

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon Mac | `videre-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` |
| Linux x86_64 | `videre-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |
| Linux ARM64 | `videre-<version>-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` |

```bash
tar xzf videre-*-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
./videre --version
```

Each archive has a `.sha256` alongside it.

:::caution[Gatekeeper on macOS]
A binary downloaded with a browser is quarantined by macOS. Either download it
with `curl`, or clear the flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine videre
```

Homebrew installs are not quarantined, so `brew install` avoids this entirely.
:::

:::caution[More than one videre will shadow itself]
If you have installed videre more than one way, whichever copy comes first on
your `PATH` wins, and `videre --version` quietly reports that one. An old
`cargo install videre` in `~/.cargo/bin` is the usual culprit.

```bash
which videre          # check which copy you are actually running
```

[Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting/) lists where each install method
puts the binary and how to remove each one properly.
:::

## From source

Needs a Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo install videre --locked
```

`--locked` builds with the exact dependency versions videre was released and
tested with. Without it, cargo picks the newest versions it is allowed, and a
dependency's later release can stop videre from compiling.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:erhangundogan/videre.git
cd videre
cargo build --release
```

On ARM64 Linux, *building from source* needs one extra flag. The released
binary does not, since it is already built with it:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+fp16" cargo install videre --locked
```

Without it the build fails with `error: instruction requires: fullfp16`. This
is the main reason to prefer the [install script](#install-script) on ARM64
Linux: it fetches a binary that already has the flag baked in, so the problem
never arises.

## Platform notes

**Intel Macs are not supported.** The ONNX Runtime dependency ships no prebuilt
binaries for `x86_64-apple-darwin`, so videre cannot be built there at all,
including via `cargo install`.

**macOS is the primary platform.** videre also runs on Linux, with one gap: HEIC
photos and video frames are decoded using a macOS system tool, so on Linux those
files are skipped (with a clear message) for thumbnails, search, and face
detection. They are still scanned, hashed, and de-duplicated. JPEG, PNG and
friends work everywhere.

See [platform support](/reference/platforms/) for the per-command matrix.

## Models are not downloaded at install

Nothing is downloaded until you run a command that needs it. Scanning,
de-duplicating, fixing dates, pruning and stats work with no model at all.

Two commands need machine-learning models, and each fetches its own from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) the first time you run it:

| Command | Model | What it is | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`videre embed`](/commands/embed/) | [`google/siglip2-base-patch16-224`](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-base-patch16-224) | SigLIP 2, Google's image/text model. Turns a photo and a phrase into comparable vectors, which is what makes "sunset over water" match a picture. | ~1.5 GB |
| [`videre faces`](/commands/faces/) | [`WePrompt/buffalo_l`](https://huggingface.co/WePrompt/buffalo_l) | InsightFace buffalo_l, two ONNX models: `det_10g.onnx` (SCRFD) finds faces, `w600k_r50.onnx` (ArcFace) turns each face into a vector so matching ones can be grouped. | ~180 MB |

Both downloads are resumable, so you can stop and rerun.

They are only fetched once and then reused, including by later runs against a
different library. The download happens at the start of the run, before any of
your photos are processed.

The gallery Map view also downloads a world map archive the first time you open
`/map`: a vector basemap (coastlines and borders) built from OpenStreetMap data
by [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com), stored once in the shared cache and used
offline afterward. It is resumable and shared across libraries, and no map or
tile request is made once it is present. Until it finishes, the map still works
from your own location clusters. The map renders it with
[MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org), with `© OpenStreetMap contributors`
shown on the map.

### Where they are stored

In the standard Hugging Face cache, shared with any other tool that uses it:

```
~/.cache/huggingface/hub/
```

Set `HF_HOME` to put it elsewhere. This is separate from
[videre's own directory](/reference/paths/), so removing a library's `.videre/` does not
delete the models, and deleting the cache means the next `embed` or `faces` run
downloads them again.

### Bigger models are opt-in

The table above is the default. If you select a different
[search model](/reference/models/), it is fetched instead:
[`siglip2-base-patch16-384`](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-base-patch16-384)
is about 1.5 GB and
[`siglip2-so400m-patch14-384`](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-so400m-patch14-384)
about 4.5 GB. Nothing downloads them unless you ask
for them by name.

:::note[Nothing is uploaded]
These are downloads only. The models run on your machine, and your photos are
never sent anywhere. Two features make an outbound request:
[`videre search --location`](/commands/search/), which looks up a place name,
and the gallery Map view, which downloads a world basemap once on first use
(below). Both fetch data in; neither sends anything about your library out.
:::

## Shell completion

Tab completion installs itself. The first time `videre` runs under **bash** or
**fish**, it writes a completion script into the directory that shell already
loads (`~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/` and
`~/.config/fish/completions/`), and refreshes it when the version changes.
Open a new shell (or re-source your setup) and tab completes subcommands,
flags, and choices such as `--xmp db|file|newest`.

**zsh** has no per-user completion directory on its load path, so it is not
installed automatically. Save the script as `_videre` in a directory on your
`fpath` - for oh-my-zsh, `~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_videre` - and run
`rehash`:

```bash
videre completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_videre && rehash
```

With `--person`, `--model`, `--tag`, `--category`, `--label`, `--ext` and
`--mime`, the value of `videre config set` (the three provided models for
`model`, and the fixed choices of the others), and inside a
[query](/reference/query-syntax/#completion), the choices come from your
library: register the dynamic completer in your shell's startup file, e.g. for
bash `eval "$(COMPLETE=bash videre)"` (zsh: `eval "$(COMPLETE=zsh videre)"`,
fish: `COMPLETE=fish videre | source`), and keep it read-only fast - videre
answers from a read-only connection and completes nothing when there is no
library.
