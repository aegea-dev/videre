Start here. Five minutes from nothing to searching your own photos.

## Install it

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh
```

No Rust toolchain, nothing to compile. On macOS, `brew install
aegea-dev/tap/videre` works too and handles upgrades for you. Both are
covered in [install](/start/install/), along with building from source and the
platform notes.

## Scan a folder

Your photo folder *is* the library. Run videre inside it:

```bash
cd ~/Photos
videre scan
```

That builds a database at `~/Photos/.videre/hashes.db` describing what you have,
and everything below reads from it. **It does not change your photos.**

Every command acts on the library it runs in, so the rest of this page assumes
you are still in `~/Photos`. From anywhere else, name it explicitly with
`videre --library ~/Photos <command>`.

## Clean up duplicates

```bash
videre dedupe                # list which copies could go
videre dedupe review         # ...or review them in a browser first
videre dedupe trash        # move the copies to the trash (asks first)
```

By default `videre dedupe` only prints a list for you to check; `trash` is
what actually deletes, moving the copies to the system trash after asking.
`--kind` picks other kinds: `resized` for the same picture at another size,
`creation` for Google Photos edits beside their originals, and `similar` for
photos and videos that merely *look* alike (after `videre embed`), which are
reported for review only, never removed.

:::caution
`videre dedupe trash` deletes immediately once you confirm (or with `--yes`).
Preview with `trash --dry-run`, or review in a browser with `videre dedupe review` first.
Changed your mind? `videre dedupe undo` puts the last run back.
`delete` removes the copies permanently instead: faster, with no undo. Use
either rather than piping the list to another tool, which splits paths on
their spaces. See [cautions](/reference/cautions/).

## Search your photos

```bash
videre embed                              # one-time: prepares photos for search
videre search "golden gate bridge at sunset"
videre search --image reference.jpg       # find photos like this one
```

The first `videre embed` downloads about 1.5 GB of model data (Google's SigLIP,
from Hugging Face; see [what gets downloaded](/start/install/#models-are-not-downloaded-at-install))
and takes a while on a big library. You can stop it at any point and rerun
later, and it picks up where it left off.

## Find people

```bash
videre faces                  # detect and group faces
videre gallery         # name the groups in your browser
videre search --person "Alice"
```

`videre faces` downloads about 180 MB the first time.

Every command takes `--help`, and [Commands](/commands/) is the full reference
with every flag.

## What needs what

Each of the above is a small pipeline: `search` needs `embed` first,
`search --person` needs `faces` plus naming, and `prune` belongs after files
are deleted or moved outside videre.

[Workflows](/start/workflows/) has the full map, plus recipes for the common
jobs and rough costs for the long ones.

## Other things it can do

```bash
videre classify                        # tag screenshots/documents/memes
videre search --category screenshot

videre locations                       # group photos by place
videre search --location "Berlin"

videre fix-dates                       # set file dates from EXIF
videre gallery                    # browse the whole library
videre stats                           # what's in the library
videre watch                           # keep everything fresh in the background
```

## Working with other tools

`videre dedupe` prints one file path per line, so a script can read the
list. To remove the copies, use `videre dedupe trash` or `delete` rather
than a pipe; for a script that must, `--print0` writes the paths
NUL-delimited so a path with a space survives:

```bash
videre dedupe > to-delete.txt             # the list, to read or feed a script
videre dedupe --print0 | xargs -0 ls -l   # NUL-delimited, space-safe
```

`videre search`, `videre dedupe`, `videre stats` and `videre locations` accept
`--json` for scripting, and [`videre mcp`](/commands/mcp/) exposes search and
duplicate review to AI agents over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "videre": { "command": "/path/to/videre", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

## Good to know

- Long jobs (`embed`, `faces`, `classify`) are resumable. Ctrl-C is safe, and
  rerunning continues where it stopped.
- Two different videre commands can run at once against the same database.
  Running the *same* command twice is refused rather than allowed to corrupt
  anything.
- `videre gallery` starts a local web server on
  `localhost:7878`. Nothing leaves your machine.
- The only feature that touches the network is `videre search --location`, which
  looks up a place name once and caches the result.
