title: Gallery HTTP interface
description: The local HTTP routes served while videre gallery is running.
---

`videre gallery` starts a small HTTP server on your own machine. The gallery
pages use that server to fetch rows, thumbnails, face data, marks and people
updates while you browse.

The interface is local. It binds to `127.0.0.1`, exists only while
`videre gallery` is running, and reads or writes the database chosen when the
server started. You can call it from your own local tools, but it is not a
hosted service and should not be exposed to other machines.

```bash
videre gallery --browse
videre gallery --port 8080
```

The examples below use `http://127.0.0.1:7878`, the default address. Without
`--port` a busy 7878 advances to the next free port, so check the startup line
before assuming `7878`; an explicit `--port` is used exactly.

:::note
Static HTML exports from commands such as `videre dedupe review` and
`videre search --html` are separate files. They do not keep this server running
and cannot answer these HTTP requests after the command exits.

## Page routes

| Route | What it serves |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | All files |
| `GET /search` | A search as a page: `?like=<hash>` ranks by an example, `?q=` words by meaning, and `q`'s filters narrow either |
| `GET /duplicates` | Duplicate review |
| `GET /people` | People and face labeling |
| `GET /date` | Date drill-down |
| `GET /date/{year}` | Files for one year |
| `GET /date/{year}/{month}` | Files for one month |
| `GET /date/{year}/{month}/{day}` | Files for one day |
| `GET /people/cluster/{id}` | One face cluster |
| `GET /people/person/{name}` | One person |
| `GET /map` | Location cluster map with the full file grid |
| `GET /map?near={lat},{lon}` | Map centred on the cluster nearest a coordinate pair (used by the lightbox place link) |
| `GET /map/location/{name}` | One addressable location drill-down |
| `GET /events` | Automatic travel-trip overview |
| `GET /events/{key}` | One trip's media (`key` is its first photo anchor's compact time and full hash) |
| `GET /settings` | Redirects to `/settings/config` |
| `GET /settings/{tab}` | The settings pages: `config`, `gallery`, or `manage` (gallery import, export and reset) |
| `GET /diagnostics` | Redirects to `/diagnostics/status` |
| `GET /diagnostics/{tab}` | The Diagnostics pages: `status`, `stats`, or `logs` |
| `GET /smart` | Reserved |

Date route segments are zero-padded where applicable: `YYYY`, `YYYY/MM` and
`YYYY/MM/DD`. Invalid date routes return `404 Not Found`.

`GET /date` also accepts range query parameters:

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `from=YYYY[-MM[-DD]]` | Inclusive lower bound |
| `to=YYYY[-MM[-DD]]` | Exclusive upper bound |

Partial bounds expand to the first day of the period. For example,
`from=2025` starts at `2025-01-01`, and `to=2018` stops before `2018-01-01`.
When `from` is present without `to`, the range runs through today. Invalid
query dates or empty ranges return `400 Bad Request`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/date/2025/06/03"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/date?from=2016-05&to=2017"
```

The reserved `/smart` route currently returns a placeholder page with
`404 Not Found`.

Map location names use the same normalized, URL-safe identity rule as people.
When more than one cluster has the same normalized name, the route selects the
largest cluster, then the lowest cluster id. The optional positive `radius`
query is measured in kilometers; without it the route uses the library's
`routes.map.radiusKm` setting when it is above 0, and otherwise the cluster's
stored radius. An unknown name still returns the working map page with HTTP 200 and an
unknown-location state.

`GET /map?near={lat},{lon}` takes a `"lat,lon"` pair instead of a name and
resolves it to the cluster whose centroid is nearest by haversine distance,
bootstrapping that cluster's drill-down. The lightbox place link uses it because
a photo's reverse-geocoded place name is finer than any cluster name; the client
then rewrites the address bar to the resolved `/map/location/{name}`. A library
with no clusters resolves to the unselected map.

## Settings

The library's gallery settings, stored in `.videre/gallery.json`. See
[settings](/commands/gallery/#settings) for the keys and defaults. Every
response has the same shape:

```json
{
  "effective": { "resume": { "route": "/" }, "routes": { "files": { "view": "list", "...": "..." } } },
  "overrides": { "routes": { "files": { "view": "list" } } },
  "ignored": [],
  "error": null,
  "path": "/Users/me/Photos/.videre/gallery.json"
}
```

`effective` is the defaults with `overrides` (the file's contents) merged on
top. `ignored` lists the dotted paths of overrides whose type does not match
the default, which the merge skipped. `error` explains why the file could not
be read, when it exists but is not a JSON object; the effective settings are
then the defaults.

Write bodies must be a JSON object sent as `application/json` or
`application/merge-patch+json`. A write answers `409 Conflict` while the file
is unreadable, so hand edits are never overwritten, and `413 Payload Too Large`
when the result would exceed 64 KiB.

### `GET /api/settings`

The current settings, read from disk, so a hand edit shows up without a
restart.

### `PATCH /api/settings`

A JSON merge patch ([RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396)) over
the stored overrides. `null` removes a key, reverting it to its default. After
every write, `PATCH` or `PUT`, any value equal to its default is dropped, so
the file only ever holds what differs. Every incoming value the settings
schema describes is checked first; any refused value answers
`422 Unprocessable Entity` with `{"errors": {"<dotted.path>": "<message>"}}`
and nothing is written.

```bash
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json' \
  -d '{"routes":{"files":{"tile":{"rowHeight":320}}}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/settings
```

### `PUT /api/settings`

Import. The body must hold a `routes` or a `faces` object, or both; each one
present replaces that stored section wholesale. Everything else in the file,
including where the library reopens, is kept. `{"routes":{},"faces":{}}`
resets every preference to its default. Values are checked as for `PATCH`.

### `PATCH /api/config`

Changes [`videre config`](/commands/config/) keys, named as `videre config
set` names them: `{"run-history": 5, "similar-min-score": null}`. `null`
unsets a key. Every value is checked before the config is written once, so a
save lands whole or not at all; a refused one answers `422` with
`{"errors": {"<key>": "<message>"}}`. The reply holds every key's value as
`values`. Turning `street-detail` off deletes the street map, and
`deleted_street_map_bytes` says how much.

## Files

### `GET /api/files`

Returns a page of file rows. By default it lists all scanned paths.

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `view=all` | All database rows. This is the default |
| `view=date` | One row per hash, ordered for the date view |
| `offset=<n>` | Page offset. The default is `0` |
| `limit=<n>` | Page size. The default is `200`, capped by the server |
| `date=YYYY[-MM[-DD]]` | Date prefix used by the date view |
| `from=YYYY[-MM[-DD]]` | Inclusive date lower bound for `view=date` |
| `to=YYYY[-MM[-DD]]` | Exclusive date upper bound for `view=date` |
| `hashes=<a,b,c>` | Comma-separated hashes to resolve after a search |
| `lat=<number>` | Center latitude for a `view=all` proximity filter |
| `lon=<number>` | Center longitude for a `view=all` proximity filter |
| `radius=<km>` | Positive radius in kilometers for a `view=all` proximity filter |
| `cluster=<id>` | Location cluster for a `view=all` district filter, given with `place` |
| `place=<name>` | One place name within `cluster`; empty means the cluster's files with no name yet |
| `sort=<date\|name\|size\|rating\|liked\|type>` | Field the files are ordered by. Default `date`. Unknown values fall back to the default |
| `dir=<asc\|desc>` | Sort direction. Default `desc`. `path` is always the final tie-break, so pages stay stable |
| `q=<query>` | A [query](/reference/query-syntax/). Its filters narrow the page and `total`; its words do not filter |

`lat`, `lon` and `radius` must be supplied together. The server first narrows
GPS-bearing rows with the coordinate index, then applies exact great-circle
distance, so the returned page and `total` describe the same circle. The date
view ignores all three parameters and keeps its own one-row-per-hash behavior.

`cluster` and `place` select one district of a city exactly: the cluster's
files whose place name is `place`, the files the map's district marker counts.
They go together, and not with `lat`, `lon` and `radius`; any other mix answers
`400`.

Every sort puts nulls last in both directions (undated files, unrated files),
and appends `path` as the final tie-break, so two consecutive pages never
share a row and "Show more" concatenates into the sorted order.

With `q`, the response adds `library_total`, the number of files in the
library, so a client can say "N of M", and `text`, the query's words when it
has any, for the client to rank through `/api/search`. A query that cannot run
answers `400 {"error": "...", "at": 7}`, where `at` is the zero-based
character offset of a syntax error, or `null` when there is none to point at.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files?limit=1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files?view=date&from=2025-01-01&to=2026-01-01&limit=100"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files?view=all&lat=52.52&lon=13.405&radius=25"
```

```json
{
  "total": 42,
  "offset": 0,
  "files": [
    {
      "hash": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "path": "/Users/me/Photos/IMG_0001.jpg",
      "ext": "jpg",
      "size": 2457600,
      "cr": "2026-04-12T10:30:00",
      "mo": "2026-04-12T10:31:00",
      "ex": "2026-04-12T10:30:00",
      "lat": 41.0082,
      "lon": 28.9784,
      "w": 4032,
      "h": 3024,
      "tb": null,
      "fb": null,
      "meta": {
        "faces": [{ "id": 12, "name": "ayse" }],
        "location": { "lat": 41.0082, "lon": 28.9784 }
      },
      "copies": 1,
      "rating": 5,
      "pick": "keep",
      "label": "red",
      "liked": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### `PATCH /api/files/{hash}`

Updates gallery marks for one hash. Every field is optional. A missing field
leaves that mark unchanged.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rating` | `1` through `5`, or `0` to clear the rating |
| `pick` | Pick state such as `keep`, `reject`, or `none` to clear it |
| `label` | Colour label such as `red`, or `none` to clear it |
| `liked` | Boolean like state |

```bash
curl -i -X PATCH \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rating":5,"pick":"keep","label":"red","liked":true}'
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
```

### `GET /api/files/{hash}/raw`

Serves bytes for one library file. The optional `size` query asks the gallery
to return a thumbnail-sized rendition when it can. JPEG and other browser-raster
renditions apply embedded EXIF orientation before resizing and encoding. The
gallery adds an opaque preview-version query when needed to keep browser and
server caches in step; local API callers do not need to supply it.

MP4 and MOV responses support one standard `Range: bytes=...` request and are
streamed from disk. A satisfiable range returns `206 Partial Content` with
`Accept-Ranges`, `Content-Range` and `Content-Length` headers. An invalid or
unsatisfiable range returns `416 Range Not Satisfiable`. This lets browsers load
video metadata without downloading whole videos or blocking image thumbnails.

```bash
curl -i \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/raw?size=512"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: image/jpeg
```

```bash
curl -i \
  -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/raw"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
accept-ranges: bytes
content-range: bytes 0-1023/2457600
content-length: 1024
```

### `POST /api/files/{hash}/rotate`

Rotates one photo 90 degrees clockwise by bumping its EXIF `Orientation` tag in
place - no pixels are re-encoded - and drops the file's cached previews so the
grid and lightbox re-render upright. The photo's display-canvas face boxes and
landmarks are turned with it, so face crops stay on their faces and keep their
people labels. Supported for EXIF-bearing images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP),
including one that has no EXIF yet, which gets its first EXIF block; any
other format (video, HEIC, and the like) returns `415 Unsupported Media Type`.
The response body carries the new orientation value.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/rotate"
```

```json
{ "orientation": 6 }
```

## Selections

The selection bar's writes. Each takes `hashes`, 1 to 10,000 content hashes
the library knows; an empty or oversized list answers `400
{"error":"invalid_parameter","field":"hashes"}`, and one unknown hash refuses
the whole request with `400 {"error":"unknown_hash"}`, so a stale page never
believes it changed something. Marks and tags are per content hash, so every
copy of a photo changes with it.

### `POST /api/files/marks`

The fields of `PATCH /api/files/{hash}` (`rating` 0 clears, `pick` and
`label` `"none"` clear, `liked`), for every hash. `pick` toggles: asking for
the pick every item already has clears it; the response's `pick` says which
was applied. A body with no mark field answers `400 {"error":"no_change"}`.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/files/marks" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"hashes":["aaaa…","bbbb…"],"rating":4,"liked":true}'
```

```json
{ "updated": 2, "pick": null }
```

### `POST /api/files/tags`

Adds `add` then removes `remove` on every hash. Tags are trimmed; blank ones
are ignored.

```json
{ "hashes": ["aaaa…"], "add": ["İstanbul"], "remove": ["draft"] }
```

### `GET /api/tags`

Every tag in the library with how many items carry it, most used first; the
selection bar's tag suggestions.

```json
[{ "tag": "İstanbul", "count": 12 }]
```

### `POST /api/files/rotate`

A quarter turn (`direction` `cw` or `ccw`) for every hash, as
`POST /api/files/{hash}/rotate` does for one. Items that cannot carry an
orientation (videos, RAW) are skipped and counted.

```json
{ "rotated": 10, "skipped": 2, "failed": 0 }
```

### `POST /api/files/delete`

Moves every file of each hash (all copies) to the system Trash, where it can
be restored, and removes their rows from the library; marks, tags and faces
stay until [`videre prune`](/commands/prune/) clears data for missing files.
With `"dry_run": true` it only counts, which the confirmation dialog shows.

```json
{ "hashes": ["aaaa…"], "dry_run": true }
```

```json
{ "items": 1, "files": 2, "photos": 1, "videos": 0, "extra_copies": 1 }
```

The real run adds `trashed` (hashes with no file left) and `failed` (`[{ path,
error }]` for files that could not be moved, which keep their rows). It needs
the library to itself: while another videre command or a `watch` stage is
working, it answers `409 {"error":"library_busy"}` and moves nothing.

### `POST /api/duplicates/trash`

Moves the copies of the Duplicates page's groups to the system Trash, keeping
each group's first file: the groups, keeper rule and removal of
[`videre dedupe trash`](/commands/dedupe/), recorded the same way, so
`videre dedupe undo` puts them back. `kinds` are the page's kinds, `q` its
query (a group with a matching file, taken whole), and `keepers`, when given,
picks the groups whose first file is one of these paths (one group's **Trash
copies**); without it every group goes (**Trash all copies**).

```json
{ "kinds": ["exact", "creation"], "q": "date:2015", "keepers": ["/Fotoğraflar/IMG_1.jpg"] }
```

```json
{ "removed": 1, "already_gone": 0, "failed": [] }
```

A review-only kind answers `400 {"error":"review_only_kind"}`, a query that
cannot run `400 {"error":"query"}`, and a library another command holds `409
{"error":"library_busy"}`; nothing is moved.

## Dates, search and locations

### `GET /api/dates`

Returns date buckets for the year, month or day drill-down.

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `level=year` | Return year buckets. This is the default |
| `level=month` | Return month buckets under `parent=YYYY` |
| `level=day` | Return day buckets under `parent=YYYY-MM` |
| `parent=<prefix>` | Parent year or month |
| `q=<query>` | A [query](/reference/query-syntax/). Only matching files are counted, and a period with none is left out |

With `q`, the response adds `matched` and `library_total`: the date view's
files (one per content hash) that match, and all of them. A query that cannot
run answers `400 {"error": "...", "at": 7}`, as `GET /api/files` does.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/dates?level=month&parent=2026"
```

```json
{
  "buckets": [
    {
      "key": "2026-04",
      "count": 18,
      "sample": {
        "path": "/Users/me/Photos/IMG_0001.jpg",
        "hash": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "ext": "jpg",
        "w": 4032,
        "h": 3024
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/events`

Returns automatic travel trips, newest first. Home is inferred from the place
group with the most assignable media. A short trip needs ten distinct files
within a rolling three-hour window that may cross midnight, including three
dated, located photos. A multi-day trip needs ten files and at least two such
photo anchors on each of two dates. Local stops within one 20 km place group can
merge. A stop outside that radius starts a separate candidate trip that must
qualify independently; a home photo or a gap over 72 hours between destination
photo anchors also ends a trip. The ten-file, three-hour, and 20 km values are
initial defaults for a future editable Gallery configuration. Videos may join a photo-established trip
but never anchor one; GPS-less media join only with supporting capture-time and
location evidence. Only full stored capture dates count. Filesystem modification
times are not used for Events.

Each `kind` is currently `trip`. `key` is the first destination photo anchor's
`%Y%m%dT%H%M%S` wall-clock time, a hyphen and its full content hash; adding an
edge file cannot rename the trip. `title` uses the dominant stop's offline
place name, or falls back to `Trip, March 2020`. `place` is the full offline
name or `null`. The `empty_reason` field is `null` when trips are present; for
an empty list it is one of `no_media`, `no_capture_dates`,
`insufficient_location_evidence` or `no_qualifying_trips`. No prior
`videre locations` or `videre embed` run is needed. Local outings, manual
membership edits, and combining events are not supported in this iteration.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/events"
```

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "key": "20200312T100000-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "kind": "trip",
      "title": "Budapest, March 2020 Trip",
      "start": "2020-03-12 10:00:00",
      "end": "2020-03-15 16:30:00",
      "count": 83,
      "place": "Budapest, HU",
      "sample": {
        "path": "/Users/me/Photos/IMG_0001.jpg",
        "hash": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "ext": "jpg",
        "w": 4032,
        "h": 3024
      }
    }
  ],
  "empty_reason": null
}
```

`q=<query>` takes a [query](/reference/query-syntax/). Trips are still found
over the whole library, so a query never splits or merges one: it keeps the
trips with a matching member, `count` counts those members, and `sample` is
one of them. None matching is `"empty_reason": "no_matching_events"`. The
response then adds `matched` and `library_total`, as `GET /api/dates` does, and
a query that cannot run answers `400`.

### `GET /api/events/{key}/files`

Returns the files of one trip, by its exact members, in the same
`{total, offset, files}` shape as `GET /api/files`. `key` comes from `/api/events`:
the first destination photo anchor's compact time, a hyphen, and its full
content hash, so two trips starting in the same second stay distinct. An
unknown or stale key (the library or
the thresholds changed since it was read) returns `404`. With `q=<query>`, only
the members that match.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/events/20200312T100000-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/files"
```

### `GET /api/query/suggest`

What can complete the term at the cursor of a [query](/reference/query-syntax/):
keys while one is typed, the library's values after `key:`, and `OR`, `-`
and `(` after a complete term. The shell completer answers from the same
function, so both offer the same things.

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `q=<query>` | The query as typed so far |
| `cursor=<n>` | Character offset of the cursor. The default is the end of `q` |
| `limit=<n>` | Most suggestions returned. The default is `20`, capped at `100` |

`start` is the character offset where the term begins: a client replaces
`q` from `start` to `cursor` with an item's `insert`. A value with a space is
inserted quoted. A person is inserted by identity, with the display name as
`label` and a `face_id` whose crop `/api/faces/{id}/image` serves. Values
match folded for case and accents, on the start of any word, so `gündo`
finds Erhan Gündoğan. Inside a quoted phrase there is nothing to suggest.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/query/suggest?q=-person:g%C3%BCndo"
```

```json
{
  "start": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "insert": "person:erhan_gundogan",
      "label": "Erhan Gündoğan",
      "kind": "value",
      "count": 214,
      "face_id": 88
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/search`

Ranks photos by text or by similarity to an existing hash: `q` with words, or
`like`. With `like`, `q` may still carry a [query](/reference/query-syntax/)'s
filters, which narrow what is ranked; words with an example, or a query that
cannot run, answer `400`.

A text query's `score` is the match probability from 0 to 1; results below
the library's `search_min_match` are left out when one is set (none by
default). A `like` search's `score` is the
similarity, from -1 to 1, kept above `similar_min_score` when that is set. See
[search](/commands/search/).

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `q=<text>` | Text query |
| `like=<hash>` | Find media similar to an existing hash |
| `limit=<n>` | Result count. The default is `24`, at most `200` |
| `offset=<n>` | Where this page starts in the ranking; `0` when absent |

`more` says whether a page after this one exists. A ranked search's `total`
counts only what was ranked for this page, so it does not answer that.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/search?q=red%20kite&limit=2"
```

```json
{
  "total": 2,
  "more": false,
  "results": [
    {
      "hash": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "score": 0.97
    },
    {
      "hash": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
      "score": 0.91
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/locations`

Resolves one coordinate pair to a place name and caches the answer in the
database.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/locations?lat=41.0082&lon=28.9784"
```

```json
{
  "name": "Istanbul, Turkey"
}
```

When the location cannot be resolved, `name` is `null`.

```json
{
  "name": null
}
```

### `GET /api/location-clusters`

Returns the clusters produced by `videre locations`, largest first. The
`continent` field is derived locally from each centroid and is used by the Map
view's world overview. A library that has not run `videre locations` returns an
empty array.

With `q=<query>`, a [query](/reference/query-syntax/), only the clusters holding
a matching file are returned, `photo_count` counts those files, and the order is
by that count. A query that cannot run answers `400`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/location-clusters"
```

```json
[
  {
    "cluster_id": 7,
    "name": "Berlin, Germany",
    "route_name": "berlin_germany",
    "centroid_lat": 52.52,
    "centroid_lon": 13.405,
    "photo_count": 42,
    "radius_km": 15.0,
    "continent": "Europe"
  }
]
```

`route_name` is the normalized addressable identity used under
`/map/location/{name}`.

### `GET /api/location-clusters/{id}/points`

Every file of one cluster with GPS, as `[lat, lon, place]`, for the Map view to
split a city into districts and street groups when you zoom in. `place` indexes
`places`, the per-file place names [`videre locations`](/commands/locations/)
writes; `-1` is a file with no name yet. Coordinates are rounded to 5 decimals
(about a metre). `q=<query>` keeps the matching files only, a query that cannot
run answers `400`, and an unknown cluster `404`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/location-clusters/7/points"
```

```json
{
  "places": ["Mitte, DE", "Kreuzberg, DE"],
  "points": [[52.52001, 13.40499, 0], [52.499, 13.403, 1], [52.51, 13.39, -1]]
}
```

## Street detail

Opt-in per library (`videre config set street-detail true`; see
[the gallery's map](/commands/gallery/#street-detail)). Off, the status is
`{"enabled":false,"state":"off"}`, any street map left on disk is deleted, the
two `POST` endpoints answer `403` and the tiles `404`.

### `GET /api/basemap/detail`

```json
{"enabled":true,"state":"ready","bytes":412345678,"cells":31,"done":0,"total":0,"error":null}
```

`state` is `absent`, `downloading` (with `done` and `total` tile bytes),
`ready`, `stale` (the library has places outside the downloaded cells) or
`failed` (with `error`). `cells` counts the 1-degree cells the library's places
touch.

### `POST /api/basemap/detail/plan`

Reads the source's directories for the cells and answers
`{"cells":31,"bytes":412345678}`, the download's size. This already tells the
host which cells are wanted, so the map calls it only after a click. A host
failure answers `502`.

### `POST /api/basemap/detail/ensure`

Starts the download in the background (the glyphs, then the tiles) and answers
the status at once; the map polls `GET /api/basemap/detail`.

### `GET /tiles/detail.pmtiles`

The library's street map, with Range support, read by MapLibre through the
pmtiles protocol. `404` when absent or off.

### `GET /fonts/{stack}/{range}`

Glyphs for street and place names, `Noto Sans Regular` in its Latin ranges,
from the machine's shared cache. Any other stack or range is `404`.

## Map basemap

The Map view renders MapLibre GL JS over an offline vector basemap: a PMTiles
archive downloaded once per machine into the shared geo cache on first use.
View time is fully offline; these three endpoints drive the one-time
acquisition and the local, Range-capable serving of the archive.

### `GET /tiles/basemap.pmtiles`

Serves the basemap archive with HTTP Range support (`Accept-Ranges: bytes`),
which is how the PMTiles protocol reads byte ranges out of the file. Returns
`404` when the archive is absent (the client then POSTs to
`/api/basemap/ensure`), `409` with the status body while a download is in
flight (the client keeps polling), and `200`/`206` once the archive is ready.

### `GET /api/basemap/status`

Reports the archive's download state, which the page polls after starting a
download.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/basemap/status"
```

```json
{ "state": "ready", "bytes": 41943040 }
```

`state` is `absent`, `partial` (a download is in progress), or `ready`.

### `POST /api/basemap/ensure`

Starts the once-per-machine download if the archive is absent and none is
already running, then returns the current status immediately (same body shape
as the status endpoint). Repeated calls while a download runs are no-ops.

### `GET /api/processing`

While [`videre watch`](/commands/watch/) runs on the library, each of its
stages that still has files to process, which the nav polls to show its
"still processing" note. `watch` is `false` and `stages` empty when no watcher
runs. Embed and classify appear only once their model is downloaded, since
watch never fetches it.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/processing"
```

```json
{ "watch": true, "stages": [{ "stage": "faces", "outstanding": 12 }] }
```

### `GET /api/diagnostics/status`

The document [`videre status --json`](/commands/status/) prints, for the
Diagnostics page: coverage, pipeline runs with their history, watch liveness,
the latest run of each command as its log records it, and date sources.

### `GET /api/diagnostics/stats`

The document [`videre stats --json`](/commands/stats/) prints, with the first
ten mismatched files.

### `GET /api/diagnostics/logs`

One page of the library's log lines, newest first, across commands and rotated
files. Query parameters, all optional:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `command` | Only this command's logs |
| `level` | `error`, `warn` (default: warnings and errors) or `info`, which reads the trace files and needs `log-level` info |
| `since` | Only lines at or after this RFC 3339 time |
| `q` | Only lines whose message or path contains this, ignoring case and diacritics (`cicek` finds `ÇİÇEK`) |
| `before` | Only lines before this RFC 3339 time: the last line's `ts`, for the next page |

A bad `level` or time is `400`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/diagnostics/logs?command=faces&level=error"
```

```json
{
  "lines": [{ "ts": "2026-10-09T15:50:01.2Z", "level": "warn", "command": "faces",
              "run": "…", "stage": null, "kind": "source_unavailable",
              "path": "/Photos/IMG_4411.HEIC", "message": "…" }],
  "more": false, "unreadable": 0, "commands": ["faces", "gallery", "scan"], "no_trace": []
}
```

`no_trace` names the commands that have no trace file when `level=info` asked
for one. Pages hold 200 lines, more only to keep lines of one instant together.

### `GET /vendor/{version}/{asset}`

Serves the vendored map libraries compiled into the binary, with a long-lived
immutable cache: `maplibre-gl.js`, `maplibre-gl.css`, and `pmtiles.js`. Loaded
only by the Map page, so the ~1 MB of script never weighs on the other gallery
views. The `{version}` segment is videre's own version, emitted by the page as a
cache buster so an upgrade fetches fresh bytes on the same port; its value is not
validated. Any other `{asset}` is `404`.

## People

### `GET /api/people`

Searches known people by their stored label or display name. Use the `name`
query to filter.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people?name=ay"
```

```json
["ayse", "ayse_yilmaz"]
```

### `POST /api/people`

Creates a person from one or more face ids.

```bash
curl -i -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Ayse Yilmaz","face_ids":[12,13]}'
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
```

### `GET /api/people/{name}`

Returns the display name and one page of the assigned faces for one
person, the primary face first. `limit=<n>` (default `200`, at most `1000`)
and `after=<id>` (the previous page's `next`) page them; `face_total` counts
them all and `next` is `null` at the end.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people/ayse_yilmaz"
```

```json
{
  "label": "ayse_yilmaz",
  "full_name": "Ayse Yilmaz",
  "faces": [
    {
      "face_id": 12,
      "hash": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "path": "/Users/me/Photos/IMG_0001.jpg",
      "is_primary": true
    }
  ],
  "face_total": 1,
  "next": null
}
```

### `PATCH /api/people/{name}`

Updates the display name for an existing person.

```bash
curl -i -X PATCH "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people/ayse_yilmaz" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"full_name":"Ayse Demir"}'
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
```

### `DELETE /api/people/{name}`

Unassigns a person from their faces.

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people/ayse_yilmaz"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
```

### `PUT /api/people/{name}/faces`

Names faces as a person, creating the person when the name is new. The
faces must be unnamed, and several faces must be one cluster's whole
unassigned group; anything else is refused with the reason.

```bash
curl -i -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/people/ayse_yilmaz/faces" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"face_ids":[12,13,14]}'
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
```

## Recluster

The People toolbar's recluster. Parameters are the eight clustering values of
[`videre faces`](/commands/faces/#clustering-parameters), by their flag names
with underscores: `eps`, `min_cluster_size`, `merge_sim`, `min_face_size`,
`max_generic_sim`, `max_landmark_error`, `min_blur`, `attach_sim`. A request
sends any of them; the rest come from the library's saved settings, then the
built-in values. Only unlabeled faces are regrouped; named faces never move.

### `GET /api/faces/cluster-params`

The parameters a recluster would use now, what the library has saved, the
built-in values, and any problem reading the saved ones.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/faces/cluster-params"
```

```json
{
  "effective": { "eps": 0.7, "min_cluster_size": 3, "merge_sim": 0.35, "min_face_size": 80.0,
                 "max_generic_sim": 0.4, "max_landmark_error": 7.0, "min_blur": 80.0, "attach_sim": 0.4 },
  "saved": { "eps": 0.7 },
  "defaults": { "eps": 0.6, "min_cluster_size": 3, "merge_sim": 0.35, "min_face_size": 80.0,
                "max_generic_sim": 0.4, "max_landmark_error": 7.0, "min_blur": 80.0, "attach_sim": 0.4 },
  "warnings": []
}
```

### `POST /api/faces/recluster/preview`

Computes the grouping these parameters would produce and writes nothing.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/faces/recluster/preview" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"eps":0.7,"min_cluster_size":2}'
```

```json
{
  "params": { "eps": 0.7, "min_cluster_size": 2, "...": "..." },
  "total_faces": 560,
  "clustered_faces": 310,
  "cluster_count": 42,
  "singletons": 250,
  "held_out": 61,
  "before": { "cluster_count": 0, "singletons": 560 }
}
```

`singletons` counts every unlabeled face left ungrouped, `held_out` the part
of them the quality gates kept out of clustering. `before` is the current
state. A value out of range answers `400` naming it:
`{"error":"invalid_parameter","field":"eps"}`.

### `POST /api/faces/recluster`

Applies the same pass: regroups the unlabeled faces, records a
`face-recluster` run (shown by [`videre status`](/commands/status/)), saves
the parameters that differ from the built-in values to `.videre/gallery.json`
under `faces.clustering` (removing the entry when none differ). From then on `videre faces` and `videre
watch` cluster this library with those values unless a flag says otherwise.

The response is the preview's, plus `"saved": true`, or `"saved": false`
with `settings_error` when `gallery.json` could not be read; the grouping is
applied either way and the unreadable file is left untouched. While a `videre
faces` or `videre watch` run holds the library's faces lock, it answers `409
{"error":"faces_busy"}` and changes nothing.

## Faces and clusters

### `GET /api/faces`

Returns the face labeling state grouped into named people, clusters and
singletons. With `q=<query>`, a [query](/reference/query-syntax/), only those
with a face in a matching file, each whole, plus `matched` and `library_total`
as `GET /api/dates` gives them; a query that cannot run answers `400`.

People and clusters always come whole. Singletons come a page at a time, in
face id order:

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `singles_limit=<n>` | Singletons in this page. The default is `200`, at most `1000`; `0` returns none |
| `singles_after=<id>` | Start after this face id; `singles_next` from the previous page |

`singles_total` counts every singleton the query keeps, and `singles_next` is
the id to page after, or `null` at the end. Paging by id keeps a page in place
when faces before it are named.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7878/api/faces"
```

```json
{
  "people": [
    {
      "label": "ayse_yilmaz",

      ]
    }
  ],
  "singletons": [
    {
      "face_id": 31,
      "hash": "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc"
