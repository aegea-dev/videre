Organised by what you see, not by which command produced it.

## `videre --version` reports an old version

Almost always more than one videre on your `PATH`. Whichever directory comes
first wins, and nothing looks wrong: the command runs, it just is not the copy
you installed.

```bash
which videre
```

Then work out where that copy came from and remove it with the tool that put it
there:

| Path | Installed by | Remove with |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.cargo/bin/videre` | `cargo install` or `make install` | `cargo uninstall videre` |
| `/opt/homebrew/bin/videre` | Homebrew | `brew uninstall videre` |
| `~/.local/bin/videre` | The [install script](/start/install/) | `curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install \| sh -s -- --uninstall` |

To list every copy at once:

```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | while read d; do [ -x "$d/videre" ] && echo "$d/videre"; done
```

:::caution[Do not just delete the file]
Deleting `/opt/homebrew/bin/videre` or `~/.cargo/bin/videre` by hand leaves
Homebrew or cargo believing videre is still installed, so `cargo install videre`
will report it as already present and skip. Use the commands above.
:::

## I installed a new version but nothing changed

Same cause as above. The install script warns about this when it runs, naming
both copies.

If you installed with the script, note that it **does not upgrade you
automatically**, and nothing tells you a newer release exists. Run the same
command again to move to one:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://videre.sh/install | sh
```

It overwrites the binary in place; nothing else is touched. See
[upgrading](/start/install/#upgrading). Homebrew handles this for you, which is
why it is the recommended route on macOS.

## Search returns nothing

Filters are applied before ranking, so a composed query can legitimately match
nothing. Work out which part is responsible by removing filters one at a time.

Every scoped run prints `N of M`, so a filter that matched nothing is visible
rather than silent. If `M` is 0, the library itself is empty for that command.

Two setup causes to rule out first:

```bash
videre stats
```

- **Nothing embedded yet.** Text search needs [`videre embed`](/commands/embed/)
  to have run. Scanning alone does not produce searchable vectors.
- **A different model.** Embeddings are stored per model, so searching with a
  model you have not embedded with finds nothing. See
  [using several search models](/guides/multiple-models/).

`--person` and `--category` need [`faces`](/commands/faces/) and
[`classify`](/commands/classify/) respectively.

## Files are skipped as unreachable

videre bounds every filesystem call, so a disconnected or sleeping drive fails
in seconds instead of hanging forever.

Hashing a file has no total time limit: as long as bytes keep arriving, however
slowly, the read goes on. A file is skipped only when its read returns nothing
for 20 seconds, or when its metadata does not answer within five. A skipped file
is not marked done, so the next run tries it again. Other whole-file reads, such
as XMP sidecars, scale their limit with the file's size; if those time out on a
slow but healthy drive, lower the assumed floor rate:

```bash
videre config set read-rate 5
```

See [tuning](/guides/tuning/#slow-drives-and-large-files).

## HEIC photos or videos are skipped on Linux

Expected. HEIC and video frames are decoded through a macOS system tool, so on
Linux those files are skipped for thumbnails, search and face detection. They
are still scanned, hashed and de-duplicated, so duplicate detection over them
works normally.

JPEG, PNG and the other common formats work everywhere. See
[platform support](/reference/platforms/).

## A command says the library is busy

A command that would clash with work already running is refused at once rather
than left waiting: the same command twice, or a command and the
[`watch`](/commands/watch/) stage that does the same work. The usual cause is
the `watch` that [`videre gallery`](/commands/gallery/) starts beside it. Check
what is running:

```bash
videre status
```

It shows what is running now, what ran last and whether it succeeded, and
whether a job marked running actually crashed. Retry once it finishes; `watch`
retries its own stages by itself.

[`videre locations`](/commands/locations/) is the longest single writer: it
recomputes every cluster in one transaction, so it holds the lock for the whole
run.

## A long job was interrupted

Just run it again. Every long job is resumable and records what it already
processed, including work that produced no result, so re-running does not repeat
finished work.

That last part matters: face detection records images where it found **zero**
faces, and scanning marks files it could not identify. Without that, every
landscape photo would be re-examined on every run. See
[long-running jobs](/guides/long-running-jobs/).

## Intel Mac: it will not install

videre cannot be built for Intel Macs at all. The ONNX Runtime dependency
publishes no prebuilt binaries for `x86_64-apple-darwin`, so `cargo install`
fails the same way the install script does. This is not something a flag or a
different install route works around. Apple Silicon Macs are fully supported.

## ARM64 Linux: the build fails with `fullfp16`

Building from source on ARM64 Linux needs one compiler flag:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+fp16" cargo install videre
```

The released binaries already carry it, so the
[install script](/start/install/) avoids the problem entirely.

## Still stuck

- [Cautions](/reference/cautions/) covers the commands that change something,
  and the situations that surprise people.
- [Where your data lives](/reference/paths/) explains how a database is
  resolved, which answers most "it is not using the library I expected".

  [github.com/aegea-dev/videre/issues](https://github.com/aegea-dev/videre/issues).
  Include `videre --version` and the exact command.
