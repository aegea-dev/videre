description: The SQLite schema videre writes, and how to query it yourself.
---

Everything videre knows lives in one ordinary SQLite file. No proprietary
format, no daemon holding it open, nothing you need videre itself to read. If
you want to answer a question videre has no command for, write the query.

```bash
sqlite3 .videre/hashes.db   # run from inside the library
```

See [where your data lives](/reference/paths/) for how that path is resolved.

## file_hashes

One row per file path. This is what [`videre scan`](/commands/scan/) writes and
what nearly everything else reads.

```sql
CREATE TABLE file_hashes (
    path        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    hash        TEXT NOT NULL,
    meta_hash   TEXT,
    size_bytes  INTEGER,
    created_at  TEXT,
    modified_at TEXT,
    ext         TEXT,
    mime        TEXT,
    phash       INTEGER,
    exif_date   TEXT,
    gps_lat     REAL,
    gps_lon     REAL,
    width       INTEGER,
    height      INTEGER,
    duration_secs REAL,
    codec       TEXT,
    location_name TEXT,
    location_cluster_id INTEGER,
    xmp_sidecar_mtime TEXT,
    capture_date TEXT,
    date_source TEXT,
    gps_source  TEXT,
    dims_oriented INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (location_cluster_id) REFERENCES location_clusters(id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT
);
```

This is the table's shape at schema 6. A schema 3, 4 or 5 library is upgraded
in place on a writable open, with no other videre command running in it;
schema 5 adds the three date and GPS source columns and schema 6 adds
`dims_oriented`, both filled by the next scan without rehashing. Older
libraries with incompatible content keys are refused:
remove their `.videre` directory and run `videre scan`.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `path` | Absolute path. The primary key, so re-scanning updates in place |
| `hash` | Identity of the file's content: BLAKE3 over the file with its metadata left out (EXIF, XMP, comments and similar). The same image with different metadata shares one hash |
| `meta_hash` | BLAKE3 over the metadata alone; changes when only metadata does. NULL for a file whose format is not parsed, whose `hash` is then the whole file's |
| `mime` | Detected from the file's leading bytes, not its name |
| `phash` | Near-duplicate fingerprint (64-bit dHash), written by [`embed`](/commands/embed/). NULL until then, and again after the file's content changes |
| `exif_date` | Camera-local, no timezone. `0000-*` values are discarded as absent |
| `capture_date` | The one date for the file, a local wall clock (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`), from the first of: EXIF, a video's Apple creation date, a Google Takeout sidecar, a video's `mvhd` time, the file's modification time |
| `date_source` | Where `capture_date` came from: `exif`, `video`, `sidecar`, `mvhd` or `mtime`. NULL until the next scan resolves it |
| `gps_source` | Where the coordinates came from: `exif`, or `sidecar` for a Takeout sidecar's `geoData`. NULL with no GPS |
| `width`, `height` | The size the file is shown at: the stored pixels turned by the file's rotation mark (a HEIC's `irot`, the EXIF orientation, a video's display matrix), so a portrait photo a phone stored landscape is taller than wide. A gallery rotation swaps them |
| `dims_oriented` | 1 once `width` and `height` are the shown size. NULL on a row stored before that, which the next scan corrects from the file's header without rehashing |
| `location_name` | Filled in lazily, not by `scan`. See [`watch --location`](/commands/watch/) |
| `location_cluster_id` | Set by [`videre locations`](/commands/locations/) |

`created_at` is always empty on Linux; the birth time needs a macOS syscall.

Date filters on [`videre search`](/commands/search/) do not match `exif_date`
directly. They match the **effective date**: `capture_date`, and for a row not
yet resolved, `exif_date` when present and not `0000-*`, otherwise
`modified_at`. That is the same rule
[`videre dedupe`](/commands/dedupe/) uses to pick which copy to keep.

:::note[hash is the join key, not path]
Faces, classifications and embeddings are all keyed by `hash`, never by `path`.
That is what lets duplicate copies of one photo share a single face detection or
embedding, and it means a file that moves keeps its work as soon as it is
re-scanned.
:::

## faces

One row per detected face, written by [`videre faces`](/commands/faces/).

```sql
CREATE TABLE faces (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    hash          TEXT NOT NULL,
    bbox          TEXT NOT NULL,
    landmark      TEXT,
    embedding     BLOB NOT NULL,
    cluster_id    INTEGER,
    person_label  TEXT,
    confirmed     INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_primary    INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    det_score     REAL,
    blur          REAL,
    oriented      INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_label) REFERENCES people(name)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT
);
```

`bbox` and `landmark` are JSON. `embedding` is a 512-dimension ArcFace vector
stored as raw f16, so 1024 bytes. `cluster_id` is assigned by grouping;
`person_label` and `confirmed` are what the labeling UI writes, and
[`search --person`](/commands/search/) reads.
Face IDs never reuse a deleted ID, including IDs retained in journal and
question provenance. Schema 4 reserves historical IDs during its one-time
upgrade from schema 3.

`oriented` is always `1`: `bbox` and `landmark` are measured on the display
canvas, the orientation a person sees.

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    name       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name  TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

A person has two names. **`name` is who they are**: lowercase, ASCII, spaces as
underscores, punctuation removed. It is what `faces.person_label` holds and what
appears in the URL, `/people/person/isil_ozyegin`. **`full_name` is what you see**:
exactly what was typed, so `Işıl Özyeğin` keeps its spelling.

That split is why `Alice` and `alice` are one person rather than two, and why
adding a surname later changes nothing but the label on screen.

Accented letters are folded rather than dropped, so `Şefik` becomes `sefik`, not
`efik`. Names differing only in case or accent therefore share an identity, which
is the intent; the primary key on `name` is what makes that guaranteed rather
than merely likely.

Libraries created before this table are migrated on the first run of a command
that writes faces, keeping the original spelling as `full_name`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE faces_scanned (
    hash        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    scanned_at  TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

This is what makes face detection resumable. Every processed image is recorded
here **including images with no faces**, which produce no `faces` row at all.
Without it, every photo of a landscape would be re-examined on every run.

## classifications

Written by [`videre classify`](/commands/classify/).

```sql
CREATE TABLE classifications (
    model_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
    hash          TEXT NOT NULL,
    category      TEXT NOT NULL,
    confidence    REAL NOT NULL,
    classified_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (model_id, hash)
);
```

`category` is `photo`, `screenshot`, `document`, `meme`, or `unknown`. The key
includes `model_id`, so two [models](/reference/models/) can classify the same
library without overwriting each other.

## marks

Written by [`videre mark`](/commands/mark/), the gallery, and `scan`/`watch`
when they read XMP. One row per marked photo; an unmarked photo has no row, and
a row left with no marks is deleted rather than kept empty.

```sql
CREATE TABLE marks (
    hash       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    rating     INTEGER,
    pick       INTEGER,
    label      TEXT,
    liked      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

`rating` is 0-5 (0 is stored as NULL, meaning unrated). `pick` is `1` keep / `0`
reject / NULL. `label` is a colour name. `liked` is a boolean. Keyed by `hash`,
so a mark follows a photo across duplicates and moves, and
[`videre prune`](/commands/prune/) drops a row once no path references its hash.
Only `rating` and `label` are portable to XMP; `pick` and `liked` stay here.

## photo_tags

Free-form tags, written by [`videre tag`](/commands/tag/) and by `scan`/`watch`
when they read `dc:subject` keywords from XMP. One row per (photo, tag) pair,
keyed by `hash`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE photo_tags (
    hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    tag  TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (hash, tag)
);
```

A tag is one flat string; hierarchy is not modelled. Tags round-trip through XMP
`dc:subject`, so [`videre export --xmp`](/commands/export/) writes them back out
for digiKam or Lightroom.

## location_clusters and geocode_cache

```sql
CREATE TABLE location_clusters (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    centroid_lat  REAL NOT NULL,
    centroid_lon  REAL NOT NULL,
    name          TEXT,
    photo_count   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    radius_km     REAL NOT NULL,
    created_at    TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE geocode_cache (
    query       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    lat         REAL NOT NULL,
    lon         REAL NOT NULL,
    resolved_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

[`videre locations`](/commands/locations/) rebuilds `location_clusters` from
scratch on every run, so `id` is not stable between runs.

`geocode_cache` is the one table written by a network call: it remembers place
names looked up by [`search --location`](/commands/search/) so a repeated query
never repeats the request.

## pipeline_runs

One row per tracked command, not an append-only log, so it holds the *last* run
of each; earlier runs are kept in [`pipeline_run_history`](#pipeline_run_history). This is what [`videre stats`](/commands/stats/) reports.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pipeline_runs (
    command      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    started_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    finished_at  TEXT,
    status       TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration_ms  INTEGER,
    summary      TEXT,
    history_id   INTEGER
);
```

Times are UTC. `history_id` is the run's own entry in `pipeline_run_history`,
when it was kept there, so status does not list it twice.

`status` is stored as `running`, `success`, `failed` or `interrupted`. A fifth
value, `crashed`, is never written: it is computed when reading, when a row says
`running` but no live process holds that command's lock.

## pipeline_run_history

The finished runs of each command, newest kept: every run is copied here when it
ends, and only the newest `run_history` (default 3) per command remain. Runs of
a stage by `videre watch` are not copied: watch reruns its stages whenever
files change, and those runs would push out the long ones. A
`running` row found when the next run starts belonged to a run that died, and is
copied here as `crashed`. `summary` holds a failure's message or
`13 file(s) skipped`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pipeline_run_history (
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    command      TEXT NOT NULL,
    started_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    finished_at  TEXT,
    status       TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration_ms  INTEGER,
    summary      TEXT
);
```

## decode_failures

Files a stage tried and could not turn into pixels, per stage (`embed`,
`faces`, `thumbnail`). A file is skipped once `fail_count` reaches 2, so one
that hangs QuickLook stops costing its timeout on every run; any success clears
its row. `kind` is why it failed, an [error kind](/guides/logging-and-errors/#error-kinds):
a `decode_failed` file is skipped for good, and any other failure, a timeout
above all, only for a day after `last_failed_at`, then tried again.
`embed --reprocess` tries embed's skipped files at once.
[`videre status`](/commands/status/) reports these files as skipped.

```sql
CREATE TABLE decode_failures (
    hash        TEXT NOT NULL,
    stage       TEXT NOT NULL,
    error       TEXT NOT NULL,
    fail_count  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    last_failed_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    kind        TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (hash, stage)
);
```

## pixel_signatures

A small greyscale copy of an image, kept to confirm that two files of different
sizes are one picture resized ([`dedupe --kind resized`](/commands/dedupe/)).
Made only for candidates, and forgotten when the image is rotated.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pixel_signatures (
    hash   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    luma   BLOB NOT NULL,
    width  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    height INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## library_state

Small bookkeeping values the library keeps about itself, such as the GPS
fingerprint the last [`videre locations`](/commands/locations/) ran on and how
long the last regroup took. Internal; nothing to edit.

```sql
CREATE TABLE library_state (
    key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## The embeddings database

Embeddings are **not** in the main file. Each library and model pair gets its
own database under `<library>/.videre/embeddings/`, attached when needed:

```sql
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    hash        TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    model_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding   BLOB NOT NULL,
    embedded_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

`embedding` is an L2-normalized f16 vector. [Search models](/reference/models/)
explains the layout and why it is split out.

To query it alongside the main database, attach it yourself:

```sql
ATTACH DATABASE '.videre/embeddings/<owner>--<model>.db' AS emb;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emb.embeddings;
```

## Useful queries

Duplicate groups, largest first:

```sql
SELECT hash, COUNT(*) n, SUM(size_bytes)/1048576.0 mb
FROM file_hashes GROUP BY hash HAVING n > 1 ORDER BY mb DESC;
```

Total space wasted by duplicates, in MB:

```sql
SELECT SUM(size_bytes * (cnt - 1))/1048576.0
FROM (SELECT size_bytes, COUNT(*) cnt FROM file_hashes GROUP BY hash HAVING cnt > 1);
```

Photos per named person:

```sql
SELECT person_label, COUNT(DISTINCT hash) photos
FROM faces WHERE confirmed = 1 AND person_label IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY person_label ORDER BY photos DESC;
```

What is in the library, by type:

```sql
SELECT ext, COUNT(*) n, SUM(size_bytes)/1073741824.0 gb
FROM file_hashes GROUP BY ext ORDER BY n DESC;
```

Files scanned but never given a type, meaning a scan did not finish them:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM file_hashes WHERE mime IS NULL;
```

Those are what an incremental [`scan`](/commands/scan/) picks up.

:::note[`NULL` and `application/octet-stream` mean different things]
`mime IS NULL` means the file was **never processed**: no scan has read its
bytes, or one started and did not finish.

`mime = 'application/octet-stream'` means it **was** read and its type could not
be identified. That is a finished result, not a failure.

The distinction is what keeps an incremental scan from retrying the same
unidentifiable file on every run forever. When deciding how to handle a file,
videre treats the sentinel exactly like `NULL` and falls back to the extension,
so an unrecognised file is still processed normally.

```sql
-- genuinely unfinished
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM file_hashes WHERE mime IS NULL;
-- read, but unidentifiable
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM file_hashes WHERE mime = 'application/octet-stream';
```
:::

## Enforced relationships

videre turns `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on every connection it opens itself,
so these four relationships are checked by SQLite, not just by the
application:

- `faces.person_label` references `people(name)`
- `file_hashes.location_cluster_id` references `location_clusters(id)`
- `face_learning_event_faces.event_id` references `face_learning_events(id)`
- `face_learning_question_faces.question_id` references `face_learning_questions(id)`

Deleting a parent that rows still reference fails with a constraint error
rather than silently orphaning children. When you delete a person, videre
unassigns their faces and invalidates their teaching evidence first; when the
location clusters are recomputed, the file references are cleared before the
old clusters are removed.

Two relationships are deliberately **not** foreign keys, because their
parents are not the rows a child belongs to:

- `file_hashes.hash` is not a key into anything: many derived rows
  (embeddings, decode failures, classification results) key on the hash, and
  one hash can appear on several paths. Deleting one `file_hashes` row must
  not cascade into the others.
- `face_learning_event_faces.face_id` and the question equivalent are
  historical provenance: they record which faces an action was about. Prune
  keeps those references even when the face row is removed, but marks an
  affected event ineligible with `source_face_pruned`. This preserves the
  journal without allowing missing source content to train a new profile.

## Writing to it yourself

videre opens every connection in WAL mode, so one writer and many readers
coexist. You can safely run `sqlite3` queries while
[`videre watch`](/commands/watch/) is running.

Reading is entirely safe. If you write, note that videre assumes `hash` is a
the content key videre computes for the file at `path`, and [`videre prune`](/commands/prune/)
deletes embeddings and cached thumbnails whose hash no longer appears in
`file_hashes`. Deleting rows by hand therefore discards the derived work for
those photos too. With foreign keys enforced, a `DELETE` of a person that
faces still reference, or of a location cluster that files still point at,
fails with a foreign-key constraint error: unassign or clear the children
first, the way videre's own writers do.

## Video columns

`duration_secs` (seconds, fractional) and `codec` (the container's format tag,
such as `avc1` or `hvc1`) are populated for video and left empty for images.
Both arrived in v0.14.0, so rows written by an earlier version have them empty
until the library is scanned again.
