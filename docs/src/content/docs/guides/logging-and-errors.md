title: Logging and error handling
description: Where videre records failures, how to read the log files, and how to control what they keep.
---

Errors printed to the terminal scroll away, especially under a long
[`videre watch`](/commands/watch/) or [`videre pipeline`](/commands/pipeline/).
videre also writes them to per-command log files inside the library, so you can
answer "what went wrong" afterwards.

## Where the logs are

```
<library>/.videre/logs/
  scan.log            # errors and warnings from `videre scan`
  search.log          # errors and warnings from `videre search`
  scan.trace.log      # only when log-level is info or debug
  scan.log.1          # an older, rotated file
```

Each file belongs to the command you ran. Every run writes one `run started`
line to it, then its errors and warnings: a run with nothing but that line went
cleanly, and it supersedes an older failed run when
[`videre status`](/commands/status/) reads the latest one.
`<command>.log` always holds that command's errors and warnings, whatever
`log-level` says.
`<command>.trace.log` exists only when you raise
`log-level` to `info` or `debug`, and holds every line at that level, errors
included, so the detail around a failure stays in one place. Detailed logging
can therefore never push an error out of the primary file.

What is recorded:

- **A command's failure**, once, with the same text the terminal shows after
  `error:`. When a command reports its failure as a JSON document on stdout
  (`--json`), the failure is still logged but not repeated on stderr, so the
  JSON output stays clean.
- **Every file that was skipped**, as a warning naming the file in
  `fields.path`: an unreadable file during `scan`, an image `embed` or `faces`
  could not decode.
- **A failed stage of `pipeline` or `watch`**, which carries on to the next
  stage. It is recorded in the file of the command you ran, with the stage in
  `fields.stage`: a scan failure inside `videre watch` is a line in
  `watch.log` with `"stage":"scan"`, never a line in `scan.log`.
- **A failed request in `videre gallery`** (anything that returned a server
  error) and **a failed tool call in `videre mcp`**.

You rarely need to open the files first:
[`videre status`](/commands/status/) shows the latest run of every command that
logged errors or warnings, with its last error, and `videre status --check`
exits non-zero when a latest run logged an error.

## Choosing what is kept

```bash
videre config set log-level debug     # error, warn (default), info, debug
videre config set log-format text     # json (default) or text
videre config set log-max-size-mb 20  # rotate at this size (default 10)
videre config set log-keep 3          # rotated files kept per file (default 5)
videre config set log-max-age-days 7  # delete rotated files older than this (default 30)
```

The settings belong to the library, in its `.videre/config.toml`. They control
the files only: what the terminal shows never changes. `log-level` decides the
trace file: `info` and `debug` create it, while `error` and `warn` leave only
the primary file, which always keeps both errors and warnings.

`info` adds everything a command prints while it works (progress summaries,
"Loading model", "wrote N record(s)") to the trace file. `debug` adds the
decisions that are otherwise invisible: the log settings in force, every lock
taken or refused, how long each `pipeline` and `watch` stage took, files
skipped after repeated decode failures, and thumbnail cache hits and misses.
Use it when reporting a problem; it grows quickly.

When a file reaches `log-max-size-mb` it is renamed to `.1` (the previous `.1`
becomes `.2`, and so on) and a new file starts. At most `log-keep` rotated files
are kept, and rotated files older than `log-max-age-days` are deleted the next
time the command runs. The active file is never deleted.

## Reading the files

The gallery's [Diagnostics](/commands/gallery/#diagnostics) page reads them for
you: its Logs tab lists the lines of every command, newest first, filtered by
command, level, time and text.

The default format is JSON Lines, one object per line, as written by the Rust
`tracing` library:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-09-23T13:01:15.109720Z","level":"ERROR","fields":{"message":"no embeddings for google/siglip2-base-patch16-224 in this library\n  run: videre embed","kind":"","remediation":"","path":"","stage":""},"target":"videre_core::error_log","spans":[{"command":"search","run":"20260923T130115Z-58217","name":"run"}]}
```

- `timestamp` is UTC.
- `spans[0].command` is the command you ran, and `spans[0].run` identifies one
  invocation (its start time and process id), so lines from the same run can be
  grouped.
- `fields.message` is the full error chain, exactly as the terminal showed it;
  `fields.kind`, `fields.remediation`, `fields.path` and `fields.stage` are
  filled in when videre knows them, and empty otherwise.

`jq` answers most questions:

```bash
cd ~/Photos
# every error
jq -c 'select(.level=="ERROR")' .videre/logs/scan.log
# just the messages
jq -r '.fields.message' .videre/logs/scan.log
# the lines of the most recent run
jq -s 'group_by(.spans[0].run) | last' .videre/logs/scan.log
```

With `log-format text`, each line is [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt)
instead, readable with `less` or `grep`:

```text
ts=2026-09-23T13:01:15.151303Z level=error target=videre_core::error_log span=run message="no embeddings for google/siglip2-base-patch16-224 in this library\n  run: videre embed" kind= remediation= path= stage= command=search run=20260923T130115Z-58220
```

Changing the format affects only new lines; older lines in the same file stay
readable.

## Error kinds

When videre knows why something failed, the line carries a `kind` and a
`remediation`. The kinds are few on purpose; most failures are environmental.

| `kind` | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `source_unavailable` | A file is missing, or it or the library could not be read from its drive (a timeout or a device error) | Reconnect the drive holding the library, then run the command again |
| `permission_denied` | The operating system refused access | Grant read access to the file or folder |
| `decode_failed` | The file could not be decoded as an image or video frame | The file is unreadable or unsupported; videre skips it after two attempts |
| `quicklook_unavailable` | HEIC and video need macOS QuickLook | These files are skipped on this platform |
| `model_unavailable` | A search or face model could not be downloaded or loaded | Check network access for the first run, or the Hugging Face cache location |
| `library_busy` | Another videre command holds the library or this command's lock | Retry when it finishes; `watch` retries by itself |
| `library_schema` | The library was created by an older videre, or by a newer one | Older: remove `.videre` and run `videre scan`. Newer: upgrade videre |
| `database` | SQLite reported an error | The message says which operation failed |

A failure without a known cause has an empty `kind`; its message is still the
full error.

```bash
# the failures that have a known cause, grouped
jq -r 'select(.fields.kind != "") | .fields.kind' .videre/logs/watch.log | sort | uniq -c
```

## Privacy

Log lines contain paths to your photos and videos. The files are created
readable by your user only (mode `0600`, in a `0700` directory), are never sent
anywhere, and can be deleted at any time: remove `.videre/logs/` and videre
starts fresh on the next run.

## When nothing is written

Logging never changes what a command does. It is skipped, with at most one
warning on the terminal, when:

- the library has not been initialized yet (no `.videre/`): reading a library
  never creates state;
- `.videre/logs/` or a log file is a symlink, which videre refuses for all of
  its state;
- the volume is read-only or full, or the file cannot be opened.

On a slow or disconnected drive, log lines are written in the background and
dropped rather than waited for, so logging cannot hang a command. If any were
dropped, videre says how many when the command ends.
