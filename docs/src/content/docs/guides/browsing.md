title: Browsing and labeling in a browser
description: A static page you can keep, or the live gallery, and which one you get.
---

`videre` can produce visual content based on the command.

- A static file saved into `<library>/.videre` folder or a local web server. You
can open static file directly via `open <filename>` command from terminal or
via finder on MacOS or via Linux equivalent.
- A local server that you need to navigate to provided URL (http://127.0.0.1:7878)
to open. There you can view your media files, duplicates, files grouped by date,
face clusters, a map and automatic events, and you can label people you know.

| You want to | Command | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Check duplicates before delete | `videre dedupe review` | A file |
| Check duplicates before delete | `videre gallery` and browse `/duplicates` | A local server |
| Find photos | `videre search --location "Berlin" --html` | A file |
| Many more features | `videre gallery` | A local server |


### Why the difference exists

A static file has to contain everything, because it is opened via `file://` with
nothing running. That makes it portable and permanent, but it cannot show
anything computed on demand.

Named faces and place names are looked up per photo, so they need a backend.
That is the whole reason `gallery` is a server rather than something that bakes
results into a file.

It also changes how images load. A static report links to your files with
`file://`. A served page cannot, because browsers refuse to load a `file://`
subresource from an `http://` page, so image bytes come through an endpoint
instead.

## Reviewing duplicates

The default, and the one to run before deleting anything.

```bash
videre dedupe review
```

Groups are sorted by wasted space, each file badged KEEP or REMOVE, with
thumbnails, sizes, dates, GPS and paths. Expand or collapse all, and re-sort by
wasted space or by date.

This is the same grouping and the same KEEP choice that
[`videre dedupe`](/commands/dedupe/) will print, so what you see is what will
happen. Group members share their pixels but not always their metadata, so you
are reviewing **which path survives**, which matters most when one copy is on a
drive you think of as the backup, and whose dates and location survive with it.

Near-duplicates found by [`dedupe --kind similar`](/commands/dedupe/) (fingerprints
from [`embed`](/commands/embed/)) appear here for eyeballing, and deliberately
never in `dedupe`'s pipeable output.

## Naming people

```bash
videre faces            # detect and group first
videre gallery          # browse /people and name people
```

[People](http://127.0.0.1:7878/people) tab has three sections:

- **People**, ones you have named (default on the right-hand side, you can move it on top)
- **Unassigned clusters**, groups it is confident about but has no name for
- **Singletons**, faces it could not group

Drag a cluster's handle onto a person card to assign it, or click **New Person**
to create one from it. One drag can name forty photos, which is the whole point.

Assigning a face to a person freezes it: reclustering and retuning never move
a named face. You remove a label here, or wipe everything with
[`videre faces --reset`](/commands/faces/#reset). Removing a person returns
their faces to the unassigned pool, and the next grouping pass regroups them.

Each cluster links to a detail page at `/people/cluster/<id>`, showing every face
full size, with per-face remove and assign for the odd wrong member. A person's
page is `/people/person/<name>`, and both link back to **People**. **Dissolve cluster** breaks a
wrongly-merged group back into singletons without deleting any faces, and is
usually a better fix than retuning the whole clustering.

Clicking a face opens the full-resolution original, served by the backend rather
than linked, since a page on `http://` cannot navigate to `file://`.

Names are saved as you assign them, so
[`search --person`](/commands/search/) works at once.

Retuning later with [`faces --recluster`](/commands/faces/) does **not** lose
names, because they are stored per face rather than per group.

## Live browsing

```bash
videre gallery
```

One server, every view on its own route. The lightbox shows each photo's named
faces, clicking one jumps to that person, and places are reverse-geocoded on
demand.

| Route | Shows |
|---|---|
| [/](http://127.0.0.1:7878/) | Every file |
| [/duplicates](http://127.0.0.1:7878/duplicates) | Duplicate groups |
| [/date](http://127.0.0.1:7878/date) | Year, month, day drill-down |
| [/people](http://127.0.0.1:7878/people) | Face groups, and where you name them |
| [/events](http://127.0.0.1:7878/events) | Trips inferred from dates and places |
| [/map](http://127.0.0.1:7878/map) | Places on a world map, with their files below |
| [/settings](http://127.0.0.1:7878/settings) | Library config, gallery settings, and their import and export |

A strip along the top of every page switches between them, so none of them needs
to be typed. [`videre gallery`](/commands/gallery/#what-is-on-each-page) lists
every route.

### HEIC is faster here than it looks

Server mode never converts HEIC up front. Thumbnails are produced per request
and taken from the [cache](/guides/caches/) when present, which is why the page
opens immediately instead of taking minutes on a HEIC-heavy library.

Warm the cache first and the first click is fast too:

```bash
videre --library ~/Photos watch --heic     # Ctrl-C once counts settle
videre gallery
```

## Sharing a report

Static reports link to your photos with `file://`, which resolves only on the
machine that generated them. Sent to someone else, the page loads and every
image is broken. Embedding the images is not offered, so a review page is for
the machine holding the photos. To write it somewhere other than the default,
give a path:

```bash
videre dedupe review ~/Desktop/duplicates.html
```

## Caveats

**The default port can move.** `gallery` binds 7878 and, when that is taken,
advances to the next free port (7879, 7880, ...), so two galleries for
different libraries run side by side without assigning ports. Check the
startup line for the address actually bound; an explicit `--port` is used
exactly and fails when that port is busy.

**Served image bytes come from an allowlist.** The endpoint only serves paths
already recorded in the database, so it is not a general file server. It does
mean anything that can reach `localhost:7878` can read those images while it is
running.

**A static report is a snapshot.** It reflects the database when generated.
After deleting duplicates, regenerate it.

**Files missing from disk are still listed.** A static page reads the database,
so a photo deleted outside videre appears until its row is removed by
[`videre prune`](/commands/prune/) or the hourly cleanup of
[`watch`](/commands/watch/).

**Similarity search needs [`videre embed`](/commands/embed/), and lives only in
`gallery`.** A static page cannot carry it: matching against every vector needs
the database, which an exported file does not have. Without embeddings,
`gallery` still serves every view and says so rather than failing.

The **Similar** button on a card or in the lightbox ranks the whole library
against that photo and opens the ranking as a page of its own, with a **Back**
link to where you pressed it. The
server does the ranking, so it works at any library size, and the page never
downloads a vector. It appears only once the library has embeddings; with none
there is nothing to rank against, so the button is omitted rather than shown and
failing when clicked.

**Nothing leaves your machine.** The server binds to `127.0.0.1`, and the pages
make no external requests.
