# videre docs

The source for <https://docs.videre.sh>, built with
[Astro](https://astro.build) + [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

```bash
yarn install      # once
yarn dev          # http://localhost:4321
yarn build        # static site into dist/
yarn preview      # serve dist/ locally
```

Yarn 4, pinned by the `packageManager` field in `package.json`. To have that
version enforced exactly rather than falling back to whatever `yarn` is on your
`PATH`:

```bash
corepack enable
```

:warning: This project sets `nodeLinker: node-modules` in `.yarnrc.yml`. Yarn's
default PnP linker **does not work here**: Astro resolves virtual module
specifiers such as `astro:toolbar:internal`, which are not real packages, and
PnP rejects them as unsound. The build fails at the bundling stage. Please don't
"modernise" this back to PnP without re-testing a full `yarn build`.

## Layout

```
src/content/docs/
  index.mdx          landing page
  start/             install, quickstart, cautions
  commands/          one page per subcommand
  reference/         paths, platforms, file types, models
astro.config.mjs     sidebar, site URL, theme
```

Adding a page means creating the file and adding it to the `sidebar` array in
`astro.config.mjs`. The right-hand table of contents, search indexing, and
light/dark theming all happen automatically.

Search is [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app), built at compile time into static
assets. There is no search service, no API key, and nothing leaves the reader's
browser.

## Deploying

`yarn build` produces plain static files in `dist/`, so any static host works.
The site is served from Cloudflare Pages at <https://docs.videre.sh>.

Project settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root directory | `docs` |
| Build command | `corepack enable && yarn install --immutable && yarn build` |
| Build output directory | `dist` |
| Node version | from `.node-version` (24.11.1) |

Two of those are load-bearing rather than boilerplate:

**`corepack enable` in the build command.** Cloudflare's build image ships Yarn
1 by default. Running it against this Yarn 4 lockfile fails, so corepack has to
be turned on first to honour the `packageManager` field in `package.json`.

**`.node-version` pins 24.11.1.** Astro 7 requires Node >= 22.12.0, verified the
hard way: a build on 22.11.0 refuses to start with `Node.js v22.11.0 is not
supported by Astro`. Pinning a bare major would leave that to chance.

`--immutable` makes the build fail if `yarn.lock` is out of date, rather than
silently resolving different versions than the ones tested locally.

## Where things belong

- **README.md** (repo root) is the GitHub and crates.io front page: what videre
  is, how to install it, a short quickstart, and links here.
- **This site** is the user-facing reference: every command, every flag, and how
  the pieces fit together.
- **CLAUDE.md** is for people and agents working *on* videre: building,
  testing and getting a change in.

When something is true for users, it belongs here, and the other two link to it
rather than restating it.
