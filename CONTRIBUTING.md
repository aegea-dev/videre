# Contributing to videre

videre is a terminal tool for managing a local media library, and it is free
software. It is written and maintained by one person, and its direction is set
by that person.

**Bug reports are genuinely useful and always welcome.** A clear reproduction
against a real library is worth more than most patches.

**If you hit a real problem in your own library, or want a feature you would
use yourself, you are welcome here.** Those are the contributions worth having,
and they are worth having because they come from someone who actually needs the
result.

What this project is not looking for is contribution for its own sake. There is
no good-first-issue list and no ambition to grow a contributor base.

For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue and agree the approach before
writing code. Direction is deliberate and not every change fits, and a rejected
pull request wastes your time more than mine, which is a bad trade for both of
us. If you want something videre is not going to do, the licence lets you fork
it, and that is a legitimate outcome rather than a failure.

## Building and testing

```bash
cargo build --release
make fmt-check                 # what CI enforces
cargo test --workspace
```

CI runs `make fmt-check` plus the full suite on Ubuntu and macOS. Both must be
green.

The browser E2E suite is opt-in while its stability baseline is established.
It uses Playwright with Chromium, starts `videre gallery` against a temporary
copy of tracked fixtures, and does not inspect a real library. Enable Corepack
once if needed, then install the Yarn 4 dependencies and Chromium before
running it:

```bash
corepack enable
make e2e-install
make e2e
```

`make e2e` builds the debug binary first. Its failure artifacts are written to
`e2e/playwright-report/` and `e2e/test-results/`, both ignored by Git. The
GitHub Actions runs the same Chromium suite for pull requests and pushes to
`main`.

Worth knowing before changing anything:

- **Normal tests and CI never download model weights.** Real inference skips
  unless you explicitly run `VIDERE_TEST_MODELS=1 make test` locally. That
  opt-in may download missing weights into your Hugging Face cache and fails
  if download, loading, inference, or a model assertion fails. CI does not
  exercise real inference, so run the opt-in suite before changing those paths.
- **Behaviour changes update the docs in the same commit.** User-facing
  documentation lives in `docs/src/content/docs/` and is published at
  <https://docs.videre.sh>.
- **Anything two subcommands need belongs in `videre-core`.** Look there for an
  existing helper before adding one to a command module.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a short guide for people and coding agents working on
  videre: building, testing and getting a change in. Surprising code has its
  reason in a comment beside it.

macOS is the primary platform. Linux works with one gap: HEIC photos and video
frames are decoded through a macOS system tool, so those files are skipped for
thumbnails, search and face detection on Linux.

## Licensing of contributions

videre is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. If a contribution of yours is
merged, you confirm that:

- the contribution is your own work, or you otherwise have the right to submit
  it,
- it is contributed under the Apache License 2.0, like the rest of the project,
- you grant the project maintainer, and their successors and assigns, a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable and sublicensable right to
  use your contribution, **including the right to distribute it under different
  licence terms in future versions of videre**, and
- you grant the project maintainer, and their successors and assigns, a
  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent licence
  to make, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer your
  contribution, alone or combined with the project, with the same right to
  sublicense it under any licence the project later adopts. This patent licence
  ends for any party who initiates patent litigation claiming the contribution
  or the project infringes.

**You keep the copyright in what you write.** This exists so the project can
change its licence later without having to find and ask every past contributor,
a problem that has stalled other projects for years. It takes nothing away from
you: your contribution remains available under the Apache License 2.0 in every
release it has appeared in, permanently.
