# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note on pre-1.0 versioning: while the version stays below 1.0.0, the **minor**
number is the compatibility boundary, which is how Cargo reads it. A `0.x.y` to
`0.x.z` change is compatible and safe to pick up with `cargo update`. A change
to `0.x` itself may break your build or require action on your library.

All four crates (`videre`, `videre-core`, `videre-api`, `videre-ml`) share a
version number and are released together.

## [Unreleased]


## [0.62.0] - 2026-10-11

### Changed

- **Stored sizes are the size each photo and video is shown at.** A phone
  stores a portrait shot landscape and marks it to be shown turned, and
  videre stored the size before that mark. Width and height now take the
  mark into account (a HEIC's rotation property, the EXIF orientation, a
  video's display matrix), so the gallery's Tile view lays portrait photos
  out portrait instead of cropping them, and XMP face regions are measured
  against the right size. A gallery rotation turns the stored size too.
- **`videre dedupe review` names people instead of cutting out their
  faces.** The page decoded every file of every group to embed face
  pictures; thousands of `similar` groups ran for hours with no output. It
  is now written in seconds.
- Settings and Diagnostics have no search box in the nav.
- The README and the docs front page open with the new motto.

### Fixed

- **The gallery rotates HEICs that have no rotation property.** Older iPhone
  photos carry only an EXIF orientation, which macOS ignores on a HEIC, so
  they could show sideways and rotating them was refused. The first rotation
  now adds the property and sets the EXIF orientation to match. No picture
  data changes, so faces, names, marks and tags stay attached.

### Upgrading

- **The library schema is now 6.** The first time this version opens a
  library it adds one column in place, which needs every other videre command
  in that library stopped (the gallery and its watch included); then run
  `videre scan` once, which corrects the stored sizes of existing files from
  their headers without rehashing. Earlier versions cannot open a library
  after the upgrade.
- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `image_decode` gains
  `displayed_size_reader`.
- **For crates depending on `videre`:** new `display_size` module;
  `heif_rotate::Error::NoRotation` is replaced by `CannotInsert(&str)`, and
  `heif_rotate` gains `displayed_size`.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- **Diagnostics in the gallery.** The `...` menu has a Diagnostics page
  with three tabs. **Status** shows what `videre status` prints: coverage,
  each command's runs with the earlier ones beneath, recent problems linked
  to their log lines, and the commands to run next; it refreshes every 10
  seconds while watch runs. **Stats** shows what `videre stats` prints.
  **Logs** lists the command logs newest first, filtered by command, level,
  time and text, with the filters kept in the address; case and Turkish
  letters do not matter, so `cicek` finds `ÇİÇEK.HEIC`. The page changes
  nothing.
- New gallery endpoints `GET /api/diagnostics/status`, `/stats` and `/logs`.

### Fixed

- A video the browser cannot play, such as an older camera clip in Motion
  JPEG or a ProRes clip, no longer leaves a dead player in the lightbox. It
  says the browser cannot play the format and offers the original as a
  download.

### Upgrading

- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `error_log` gains
  `read_lines`, `LogQuery` and `LogPage`; `person` gains `search_fold`.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- **`videre watch` prunes by default**, including the watch the gallery
  starts. A file deleted or moved outside videre used to stay in the
  library until a manual `videre prune`. Prune keeps its guards when
  unattended: a missing folder is left alone, and an implausibly large
  share is refused. `--no-prune` leaves the stage out.
- **The gallery's Delete and the Duplicates page's Trash clean up at
  once**, as `dedupe trash` does: a removed item's marks, tags, faces and
  embeddings go with it, recorded as a prune run. An undo brings the files
  back for watch to process again.
- **A file skipped after two failed decodes is tried again unless it is
  broken.** A QuickLook timeout under load used to skip a good photo for
  good, exactly like a corrupt file. Now only a file that is not a
  decodable image stays skipped; a timeout, an unreachable drive or an
  unknown cause rests for a day, then any run, watch included, tries it
  again. Files skipped by an earlier version are retried within a day.
- `videre status` shows run times in local time, as the problems below
  them already were, aligns its name column, and shows a run in progress
  as running.
- Watch's stages no longer fill `videre status`'s run history with
  sub-second cycles; the history keeps the long runs it is for.

### Fixed

- `fix-dates` dates photos taken in the hour the clocks change. The
  repeated hour takes its first pass and the skipped hour reads as the
  clock after the jump; both used to fail on every run. Run `fix-dates`
  again to fix the ones it skipped.
- A date `fix-dates` cannot read is a warning, counted apart in its
  summary, so `videre status --check` no longer alerts on it; `status`
  counts such files as skipped rather than done.
- `videre dedupe review` says where it wrote its page once, and keeps
  quiet under `--silent`.

### Docs

- The guides and reference were checked against the code and corrected
  throughout; the prune page says when a manual prune is still needed.
- A flag in a table's first column no longer wraps.

### Upgrading

- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `decode_failures::record`
  takes the failure's `Option<ErrorKind>`, and `decode_failures` gains
  `RETRY_AFTER`. `pipeline_runs` gains `track_cycle_in_as`.
- **For crates depending on `videre-ml`:** `WorkerMsg::DecodeError` has a
  `kind` field.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- **Settings in the gallery has three tabs.** **Library config** edits
  every `videre config` key, and **Gallery** edits the gallery settings,
  grouped by the page they belong to: People holds face learning, the
  clustering parameters and the people layout. Each setting shows its
  control and range, a value is checked as you type, and **Save** writes
  every change at once or none, saying which values it refused. A setting
  that differs from its default is tinted and has a reset button. Turning
  street detail off there deletes the street map at once.
- **Gallery Import/Export** (the former settings page) now exports,
  imports and resets the face learning and clustering settings too. A file
  exported by an earlier version still imports, and leaves the face
  settings as they are.

### Changed

- A gallery settings save (`PATCH` or `PUT /api/settings`) refuses a value
  of the wrong type or out of range with `422` and a message per value,
  where it used to store it and ignore it. A hand-edited file is read as
  before.
- `videre config set street-detail false` says how much it deleted.

### Upgrading

- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `basemap_detail::remove`
  returns the deleted street map's size (`Option<u64>`) instead of `bool`.
  `library_config` gains `edit_many`, `KEYS`, `KeySpec`, `Kind`, `Applies`,
  `spec_for`, `value_json` and the range constants `IO_WORKERS_MAX`,
  `RUN_HISTORY_MAX`, `SEARCH_MIN_MATCH_RANGE` and `SIMILAR_MIN_SCORE_RANGE`.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- **`videre status` keeps each command's last runs, not only the
  latest.** A long run used to vanish as soon as the command ran again,
  and the long runs are the ones worth seeing. `status` now lists the
  earlier runs under each command's line, and as `history` in `--json`.
  A run that died is kept as crashed when the next one starts, and a run
  that skipped files says how many. Set how many runs are kept per command
  with `videre config set run-history` (default 3, 1 to 100).

### Upgrading

- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:**
  `pipeline_runs::PipelineRunStatus` has a new `history` field and
  `pipeline_runs::RunRecord` and `note_skipped` are new;
  `library_config::LibraryConfig` has a new `run_history` field and
  `library_config::ConfigKey` a new `RunHistory` variant.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- **The map splits a city into districts, then streets.** Zoomed past a
  city, its marker becomes one marker per district, counted; closer in,
  the files group into street-sized markers. A district or street group
  can be selected and linked to (`?place=`, `?at=&radius=`), and zooming
  back out past it clears the selection.
- **Street detail on the map, opt-in.** With
  `videre config set street-detail true`, the map offers to download
  roads, buildings, parks and street and district names for the areas
  your photos are in. It shows the size and what leaves the machine
  first: whole 1-degree areas around your places, never a place's exact
  location. The download is a regional cut of the OpenStreetMap planet
  map, about 55 MB for a city such as Berlin, and the map offers an update
  when new places fall outside it. Turning the setting off deletes it.
- **A Working with AI agents guide**, on what makes videre easy for an
  agent to drive and how to keep control, with the CLI and MCP side by
  side.

### Changed

- **`pipeline` counts a stage that only skipped files as done.** `faces`
  files it could not decode, and `fix-dates` files it could not update,
  no longer mark the stage failed; pipeline prints "(n file(s) skipped)"
  and reports `items_skipped` in `--json`. Run alone, both still exit 1.
  A failed database write still fails the stage.
- **`videre locations` names every photo's place**, as `watch` already
  did. A library kept current with `pipeline` had no per-file place
  names, so `place:` matched only city names and the map could not split
  a city.
- **Every MCP config in the docs passes `--library`.** A client starts
  `videre mcp` from its own folder, so the bare command found no library.
  The MCP page says how to register one server per library and when MCP
  is the better way in.
- **The gallery reads its settings once**, refreshed when a page renders
  or settings are saved, instead of reading `gallery.json` on every face
  learning action and Duplicates request. A hand edit still applies on
  the next page load.

### Upgrading

- **Run `videre locations`** (or `videre pipeline`) once so every photo
  with GPS gets its place name and the map can show districts. A library
  kept current with `watch` already has them.
- **MCP configs written from the old docs** should add
  `--library <path>` to the `videre mcp` arguments.
- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `basemap_detail` is a new
  module and `location::name_unnamed_rows` is new;
  `library_config::LibraryConfig` has a new `street_detail` field and
  `library_config::ConfigKey` a new `StreetDetail` variant.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-10-07

### Breaking changes

- **`videre dedupe` has one subcommand per action.** `videre dedupe [list|review|trash|delete|undo]`
  replaces the flags `--trash`, `--delete`, `--undo` and `--html`, which are
  gone. Bare `videre dedupe` still lists exact copies. `--edited` and
  `--similar` are gone too: use `--kind creation` and `--kind similar`.
  Scripts that call the old flags fail with a usage error.
- **The duplicates JSON is `schema_version` 2.** `dedupe --json` and the MCP
  `find_duplicates` tool return `kinds`, `unchecked` and one `groups` list,
  each group with its `kind` and either `keep` and `remove` or, for the
  review-only `similar` kind, `files`. `duplicate_groups`, `similar_groups`
  and `edited_pairs` are gone, and `find_duplicates` takes `kinds` instead of
  `include_similar`.

### Added

- **Duplicates by kind.** `--kind` takes `exact` (identical content, the
  oldest copy kept), `resized` (the same picture at another pixel size, the
  largest kept), `creation` (a Google Photos `-edited`, `-EFFECTS` or `-SMILE`
  file beside its original, the original kept) and `similar` (look-alike
  pictures, review only). Kinds combine: `--kind exact,resized`.
- **Resized copies are confirmed by their pixels.** Pairs within 4
  fingerprint bits are decoded once, at 64x64 greyscale, and kept in the
  library; a pair groups when the decoded sizes differ, the shapes agree
  within 1% and the pixels within a mean difference of 0.5. Run `videre embed`
  first for the fingerprints.
- **`--query` and the path and media filters on every dedupe action but
  `undo`.** A group is chosen when any of its files matches, and is then taken
  whole, so a copy never stays because only its keeper matched.
- **`is:creation`** in the query language finds Google Photos creations beside
  their originals; `-is:creation` hides them in any tab or command.
- **The gallery's Duplicates page shows the same groups**, labelled by kind,
  with a header line per kind. **Kinds** in its toolbar picks which
  (`routes.duplicates.kinds`), **Trash copies** on a group and **Trash all
  copies** move the copies to the system trash keeping each group's first
  file, and `videre dedupe undo` puts them back.
- **Gallery:** an x in the search box clears every filter and the typed words;
  the lightbox's file name has a copy button; the more menu has **Help** and
  **Feedback**, which open the docs.
- **A Feedback page in the docs**, with feedback@videre.sh and the GitHub
  issue tracker.
- Shell completion offers the dedupe actions and kinds.

### Changed

- **Select sits at the right end of the gallery toolbar**, with its "Select
  enabled" note, so turning it on no longer moves the other controls.
- **Google Photos creations pair across extension case and their own
  counter**: `IMG_1-SMILE.jpg` beside `IMG_1.JPG`, and `IMG_1-EFFECTS(1).jpg`
  beside `IMG_1.jpg`. The Takeout import hint now points at
  `videre dedupe review --kind creation`.
- A gallery rotation also forgets the photo's fingerprint and pixel signature,
  so the next `embed` and dedupe check take them again from the upright
  pixels; `videre prune` drops signatures of files that are gone.

### Fixed

- **The map's Radius input** uses the gallery toolbar's style instead of a
  dark one of its own.


## [0.55.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- **Search and filter in every tab's toolbar.** On Library, Date, Events,
  Map, Duplicates, People and Search, the query box sits in the tab's own
  toolbar beside Sort, with a **Filter** button for the options panel, and
  acts on what that tab shows. Pages without a toolbar keep it in the nav.
- **Page sizes per section.** `gallery.json` gains `routes.date.pageSize`,
  `routes.search.pageSize`, `routes.people.pageSize` and
  `routes.duplicates.pageSize` beside `routes.files.pageSize`, and the
  Settings page has a box for each.
- **`/api/search` takes `offset`** and says whether a next page exists
  (`more`); `/api/faces` pages singletons (`singles_after`,
  `singles_limit`, `singles_total`, `singles_next`) and `/api/people/{name}`
  pages a person's faces (`after`, `limit`, `face_total`, `next`).

### Changed

- **Gallery grids load as you go.** A day, month or range in the Date view
  no longer stops at 500 files; the Search page shows more than 96 results;
  `/people` and a person's page load faces as you scroll, and naming or
  dropping a face updates the page in place instead of reloading every face.
  The lightbox steps into the next page when it reaches the end.
- **The gallery toolbar stays in view.** It sticks under the nav, with the
  query's "N of M" line under it. Select comes first, and a divider sets
  each feature apart: Select, View, Sort, Search and filter, then the page's
  own controls. The box, its suggestions and the Filter panel match the
  toolbar's controls and stay inside the window on a small screen.

### Fixed

- **Expand all on Duplicates no longer loads every image at once.**
  Opening a group kept its images lazy only until it opened; now they load
  as they come near the screen.
- **`/api/search?like=` with `limit=1` returned nothing**, because the example
  ranked itself first and was then dropped.


## [0.54.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **`videre status` says where dates come from:** how many files are dated
  by EXIF or the video's own date, a Google Takeout sidecar, a video
  container time, or the file's time alone, so a library dated only by
  file times (an unpacked export) is visible. While rows wait to be dated,
  it asks for a scan.

### Changed

- **One capture date per file, on one clock.** `scan` now stores each
  file's capture date and where it came from: its EXIF or video date, else
  its Google Takeout sidecar, else the video container's time, else the
  file's own time, always as local wall-clock time. Date filters, the
  gallery's date pages, Events and search sorts all read it. A Takeout
  library is now dated correctly by `scan` alone, and a file with no GPS
  takes its place from the sidecar.
- **`fix-dates` writes every recovered date**, from EXIF, a video or a
  Takeout sidecar. **`import` no longer changes file times**; it reports
  what the sidecars hold and points at `scan` and `fix-dates`. The two
  used to write different clocks to the same photo and undo each other.
- **Text search keeps its best matches by default.** The 10% match floor
  from 0.52 hid real matches on short queries (a subject the library
  holds scored 1%, an absent one up to 25%), so `search_min_match` now
  defaults to 0 and is an opt-in floor. An empty search mentions the floor
  only when one is set.
- **The gallery's People pages load face crops as they scroll into
  view**, and assigning, naming and removing faces go first. A real
  Takeout library's People page requested 11,941 crops at once, and an
  assignment could wait up to 20 seconds behind them; it now loads about
  45 on open.
- **The README and docs show the query language**, and every duplicate
  removal points at `dedupe --trash` or `--delete` instead of a pipe to
  `trash`, which split paths on spaces. `--help` and the MCP search
  description are up to date.

### Fixed

- **Video dates from the container's own time were hours off.** That
  time is UTC and was stored as if it were local; it is now converted.
- **A Takeout file named `X.jpg-large.jpg`** finds its sidecar, which
  kept the original name, so it gets a date.
- **An EXIF time of hour 24** is read as midnight of the next day.
- **A gallery date page that failed to read a row** now reports the
  error instead of showing an empty day.

### Upgrading

- **Schema 5.** The first writable command (`scan`, `watch` and the like)
  adds three columns to the library in place; every row is kept, and the
  next `scan` or `watch` fills in capture dates without hashing any file
  again. A read-only command asks for a writable one first. Older
  versions refuse a schema 5 library.
- **Run `videre scan`** after upgrading so dates, filters and Events use
  the resolved capture dates; for a Takeout library, then
  `videre fix-dates` to set file times.
- **If you rely on the 0.52 search floor**, set it back with
  `videre config set search-min-match 0.1`.
- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `capture_date` is a new
  module; `status_report::StatusReport` has a new `dates` field and
  `video_meta::VideoMeta` new `date_source` and `mvhd_unix` fields, so
  build them with all fields; `query::EFFECTIVE_DATE_SQL` prefers the new
  `capture_date` column; `library_config::SEARCH_MIN_MATCH_DEFAULT` is 0.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **`videre dedupe --undo`** puts back what the most recent `--trash` run
  moved to the trash; run it again for the run before, newest first. Every
  `--trash` run and every gallery **Delete** records what it moved, file by
  file, in `.videre/trash/`, so a run stopped halfway can be undone exactly
  as far as it got. A file comes back only if its content still matches,
  never over a file already at its path, and is scanned back into the
  library. `--dry-run` lists what would come back, `--json` reports each
  file. No Full Disk Access is needed.
- **`videre dedupe --delete`** removes the duplicate copies permanently,
  for when you do not need them back or a volume has no trash. It asks with
  that wording first.

### Changed

- **`dedupe --trash` is fast on macOS.** It used to ask Finder to trash each
  file in turn, about 4 files a second, waiting behind any Finder dialog and
  needing permission to script Finder. It now uses the system's file
  manager directly: measured at about 400 files a second on an internal
  disk and 1,600 on a USB drive, with no Finder prompt.
- **`dedupe --trash` and `--delete` show their progress** and report each
  file that cannot be removed as it happens, so a long run never looks
  frozen.
- **Each removed copy leaves the library as it goes.** A run stopped
  halfway leaves the library listing exactly what is still on disk, and a
  copy an earlier run already removed counts as `already gone`, not as a
  failure.
- **The cleanup after a removal is named** (`Cleaning up the library, as
  videre prune does:`), and `fix-dates` points at `videre prune` when files
  it skipped are no longer on disk.

### Upgrading

- **`dedupe --remove` is now `dedupe --trash`.** The old flag is gone;
  scripts using it fail to parse until updated.
- **Runs trashed by 0.52 or older have no undo record.** Those went through
  Finder, so Finder's **Put Back** works for them.


## [0.52.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **`search_min_match` and `similar_min_score` settings**, set with
  `videre config set search-min-match` and `similar-min-score`: the least
  match a text search keeps (default 0.1), and an optional floor for image
  searches and the gallery's **Similar**. `videre config` shows both.

### Changed

- **Search keeps only real matches.** A text search's score is now the
  model's own match probability, from 0 to 1, read from its trained scale
  and bias, everywhere a score is shown: `--scores`, `--json`, MCP and the
  gallery. Matches below 10% are left out, so a query nothing fits returns
  nothing instead of the least bad photos, and fewer than `-k` results is
  normal. The score means the same for every model; raw similarity did
  not. Image searches keep their similarity score.
- **The search models are SigLIP 2.** The default is now
  `google/siglip2-base-patch16-224`: the same size and speed as the model
  it replaces, and it understands queries in many languages, Turkish
  included. Measured on 300 photos searched by their captions, it found
  the right photo first for 84% of English and 52% of Turkish queries,
  against 81% and 37% before. Completion and the docs offer
  `siglip2-base-patch16-224`, `siglip2-base-patch16-384` and
  `siglip2-so400m-patch14-384`; the largest found 88% and 78%, at about
  18 times the embedding time. Any SigLIP 1 model still works when named.

### Fixed

- **An apostrophe inside a word no longer breaks a query.**
  `İstanbul'da deniz`, `the dog's toy` and `tag:ayşe'nin` failed with
  "missing delimiter"; an apostrophe after a letter or digit is now part
  of the word.
- **A query error points at the right character** when Turkish letters
  come before it; it used to count bytes.
- **A gallery text search that cannot parse** answers with where the
  mistake is, instead of a server error.

### Upgrading

- **Existing libraries keep their model.** A library's `config.toml`
  names the model it was created with, so it stays on
  `google/siglip-base-patch16-224` until you switch, which means one full
  embed:

  ```bash
  videre config set model google/siglip2-base-patch16-224
  videre embed
  ```

- **Search returns fewer results.** To get every ranked result back, run
  `videre config set search-min-match 0`. Scripts that filtered `--json`
  on a cosine `score` need a new threshold: a text score is now a 0 to 1
  probability.
- **For crates depending on `videre-core` or `videre-ml`:**
  `library_config::LibraryConfig` has the new fields `search_min_match` and
  `similar_min_score` and is no longer `Eq`; `library_config::ConfigKey`
  has the new variants `SearchMinMatch` and `SimilarMinScore`;
  `embeddings::DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` names the SigLIP 2 model.
  `videre_ml::search::Calibration` and `Embedder::calibration` are new.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **One query language for search and filters.** `videre search` takes a
  query in the style of Gmail and GitHub search:

  ```bash
  videre search 'person:özgür "gün batımı" -tag:ekran (tag:deniz OR tag:plaj) rating:>=4'
  ```

  Words without a key rank by meaning as before; `key:value` terms filter,
  combined with `OR`, `-`/`NOT` and parentheses, and narrow together with
  the flags. Keys: `person`, `people`, `tag`, `category`, `place`, `date`,
  `after`, `before`, `rating`, `pick`, `label`, `is`, `type`, `ext`,
  `mime`, `path`, `has`, `missing`. `place:` matches the library's own
  place names, offline. A query that cannot run says why and at which
  character. See the new [Query syntax](https://docs.videre.sh/reference/query-syntax/) page.
- **`--query` on every command that works over rows**: `embed`, `faces`,
  `classify`, `tag`, `mark` and `export` take the query's filters, for the
  `OR` and `NOT` the flags cannot say. The MCP `search` tool takes the
  language in `query`.
- **`people:` and `videre search --people`** find everyone whose name has
  the given words, whole and in order, ignoring case and accents:
  `people:Erhan` finds Erhan Gündoğan and Erhan Kaya, not Serhan.
  `person:` still names exactly one person.
- **Every gallery page takes a query.** The search box narrows Library,
  Date, Map, Events, Duplicates and People in place, with a "N of M match"
  line, and the section links carry the query from page to page:
  - Date counts only matching files and hides empty periods;
  - Map shows only the places holding a matching file;
  - Events keeps the trips with a matching file and narrows each trip;
  - Duplicates shows the groups with a matching copy, whole;
  - People lists those seen in a matching file.
- **The gallery's search box shows filters as chips**, with suggestions
  from the library while you type (people with their faces, tags, places,
  categories and more, most used first). A chip has a not toggle, any/all
  for several values, and a remove button; a part of the query chips
  cannot show stays as one chip with its text.
- **An options panel** beside the search box lists every kind of filter
  with this library's values and counts; choosing values writes chips, and
  Apply runs the query.
- **A search has a page of its own**: `/search?like=<hash>` for files like
  one, `/search?q=...` for words, both within the query's filters. Similar
  and text results gain **Open as a page**, and a bookmark reopens it.
- **Tab completes the query and more.** With the dynamic completer
  registered, Tab completes a query's last term in bash, zsh and fish
  (keys, then the library's values), `--tag`, `--category` and `--label`
  from the library, and the provided models for every `--model`. The fish
  script installed automatically completes `videre config set`'s keys and
  each key's choices, such as the three provided models for `model`.

### Changed

- **`videre search`'s argument is a query.** Words still rank as before,
  but a word with a colon is now a filter, and `OR`, `NOT` and a leading
  `-` are operators: quote a phrase (`"a:b"`) to search for it as text.
  A query that starts with `-` goes after `--` (or starts with `NOT`). A
  query that cannot run exits 1.
- **`--image` may come with a query that only filters.** Words and an
  example image both rank, so that pair is refused.
- **The gallery's search box stays on a library without embeddings**,
  offered as a filter, since a query's filters need no vectors.

### Fixed

- **The gallery's search box showed "Search or filterplaceholder="** as its
  placeholder.
- **`videre config set mo<Tab>` listed files in fish**, and nothing
  completed the value after `model`.
- **`--model` on `search`, `gallery` and `mcp` completed nothing.**

### Upgrading

- **Re-quote searches with colons or `OR`/`NOT`** that were meant as text,
  for example `videre search '"10:30 meeting"'`.
- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `selection::RowSelection` has
  new fields `place_name`, `query` and `people`; build it with
  `..Default::default()`. `embeddings::PROVIDED_MODELS`,
  `query::by_place_name` and `query::by_people` are new.
- **The completion scripts refresh themselves** on the first run of the new
  version; to pick up the fish `config set` completion by hand, run
  `videre completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/videre.fish`.


## [0.50.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **The gallery rotates HEIC photos.** The lightbox and selection bar turn a
  HEIC by its rotation property, the one iPhones write and Photos and Preview
  display by, and keep its EXIF orientation in step. The file keeps its size
  and its identity, so faces, names, marks and tags stay attached. A HEIC
  saved without that property is refused and left untouched.
- **The gallery keeps the library current.** Opening it starts
  `videre watch` beside it, so files added or changed while browsing are
  processed without a second terminal. A watch already running for the
  library is used and left running. The gallery's own watch stops when the
  gallery does, and stops by itself within a second or two if the gallery is
  killed. Turn it off with `videre config set gallery-starts-watch false`.

### Changed

- **A rotation redoes what the old orientation produced.** Rotating a photo
  in the gallery, JPEG or HEIC, now also drops its search embedding and its
  category, next to the cached previews it already cleared. The next
  `videre embed`, or the watch, redoes that photo alone. Before, search and
  classify kept seeing it sideways, and nothing short of
  `videre embed --reprocess` fixed it.
- **Gallery delete and regroup wait up to five seconds for a busy library**
  instead of refusing at once, so a watch stage finishing up no longer makes
  them fail.
- **`videre export --xmp` writes only your tags as keywords.** It used to add
  the photo's category too, and the next scan read that keyword back as a tag.

### Fixed

- **Categories turned into tags after a rebuild.** A library rebuilt from its
  sidecars gained tags such as `photo` and `unknown` from the category
  keywords older exports wrote, and removing them did not stick. The next
  full export drops the category keyword from each sidecar.

### Upgrading

- **Remove category tags a rebuilt library picked up**, once, if you see
  them:

  ```bash
  videre tag --remove photo --remove screenshot --remove document --remove meme --remove unknown
  videre export --xmp
  ```

- **For crates depending on `videre-core`:** `xmp_gather::Gathered` no
  longer has a `category` field.
- **Opening the gallery on a library that was never processed** now starts
  the whole scan, faces and embed pipeline in the background, including a
  one-time download of the face model if it is missing, the same as
  `videre watch`.

## [0.49.2] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **The release archives include the shell completion scripts**
  (`videre.bash`, `videre.zsh`, `videre.fish`), generated by the binary they
  ship with. 0.49.1's archives left them out.

### Changed

- **`config.toml` is read as TOML 1.1**, which also accepts unquoted
  non-ASCII keys. What `videre config set` writes back is unchanged.
- **Dependency upgrades:** `kamadak-exif` 0.6, `roxmltree` 0.21,
  `tower-http` 0.7, `toml` 1 and `rmcp` 3. EXIF dates and GPS, XMP sidecars,
  gallery video and map serving, and the MCP server's protocol and tool
  schemas behave as before.

### Fixed

- **A lock videre had just released could briefly still count as held** while
  videre was starting another process, so the next step or command on that
  library was refused as busy. Locks are now released explicitly rather than
  when their file closes.

## [0.49.1] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Shell tab completion.** Commands, flags and fixed values (`--type
  image|video`, `--has`/`--missing gps|date`) complete in bash, zsh and fish.
  videre installs and updates the script itself for bash and fish when it runs
  under them, into the directory that shell already loads, and never
  overwrites a file it did not write; `videre completion <bash|zsh|fish>`
  prints it, and the install guide covers zsh. With the shell's dynamic mode
  registered, `--person`, `--model`, `--ext` and `--mime` complete from the
  library itself, including one named with `--library`.
- **`videre watch` finishes every new file in one batch.** A file it picks up
  is now also grouped with its people, placed on the map, embedded and
  classified (the new default-on `--embed` stage) and, with XMP export on,
  given its sidecar, within seconds instead of on the hourly pass. On a large
  library, where the full regroup and place recompute take minutes, a batch
  attaches only the new faces and photos and the maintenance pass rebalances.
  Watch never downloads the model; until `videre embed` has, it says so once.
- **Watch says what each file got.** After each batch, one line per file names
  its stages and why any is missing, and the gallery nav shows "still
  processing" while a watcher has work outstanding.
- **Bulk imports.** From 1,000 waiting files, watch scans as files arrive and
  runs everything else once over the whole import after 30 quiet seconds.
  Both are settable: `videre config set watch-bulk-threshold` and
  `watch-bulk-quiet-ms`.

### Changed

- **The People page's Recluster controls are an aligned form**, one parameter
  per line, with an info icon on each explaining the value, which way to move
  it and its default. A blank or out-of-range value is refused with a message
  naming the field; before, a blank field was dropped and Preview silently
  used the saved value.

### Fixed

- **The duplicates header read 0 for a Google Takeout library** whose groups
  were all edit pairs. It now adds a "Google Photos edits" count and the size
  `dedupe --edited` would free, in the gallery and in `dedupe --edited --html`.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **A back-to-top button on the gallery's grid and list pages.** A small up
  arrow appears in the bottom right once you scroll past the first screen and
  scrolls smoothly back to the top. It is not shown on the People pages, where
  the people list occupies that corner.

### Removed

- **`videre scan --retry-incomplete` and `videre scan --similar`.** Both only
  printed a deprecation notice: scan is incremental by default, and
  near-duplicate fingerprints come from `videre embed`. A script that still
  passes either flag now fails with an unknown-argument error.

### Changed

- **Every empty gallery page looks the same:** one centred message under the
  nav, with toolbars and layouts hidden. Library, Date, Events, People and Map
  now match Duplicates, and a map with photos but no places counts as empty.
  The empty Duplicates page points to `videre embed`, then
  `videre dedupe --similar`, for near-duplicates.
- **The selection bar's like button reads as pressed** (blue, filled heart)
  only when every selected item is liked, and likes or unlikes them all. Clear
  matches the other buttons, and the bar no longer shifts as the count changes.

### Fixed

- **`videre mark --export-xmp` erased the rest of a sidecar.** It rewrote a
  sidecar `videre export --xmp` had written with only the rating, losing the
  face names, place and keywords. It now writes only the rating and colour
  label and leaves everything else.
- **A cleared rating or label came back from the sidecar.** Clearing a mark
  and exporting left the old value in the sidecar, and the next
  `scan --xmp file` restored it. Both exports now remove cleared fields from
  an existing sidecar.
- **A rating stored inside a photo was ignored whenever it had a sidecar.**
  Scan now reads each field from the sidecar when it has one and from the
  photo otherwise, and keeps keywords from both.
- **Removing a photo left its XMP sidecar behind.** `videre dedupe --remove`
  and the gallery's Delete now move the photo's `.xmp` sidecar to the trash
  with it.

## [0.48.1] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **`videre stats` reports files whose name disagrees with their content**,
  such as a `.png` that holds a JPEG, from what the last scan detected. It
  shows the count and the first 10 paths; `--mismatched` lists them all, and
  `--json` carries them as `mismatches`. Normal container differences, such
  as a `.mov` holding MP4 video, are not reported.
- **`videre scan` shows progress within a large file.** While a file of 1 GiB
  or more hashes, its bytes read, size and read rate appear beside the
  progress bar, or in a log line every 30 seconds without a terminal.

### Fixed

- **Two videre commands at once could skip HEIC and video files.** Each
  process limited itself to 6 simultaneous QuickLook conversions, so two
  processes ran 12, and a file that converts in 5 seconds alone timed out
  and was recorded as undecodable; two such runs skipped it for good. The
  limit is now shared by every videre process on the machine, whichever
  library it works on, and waiting for a turn never counts toward the
  timeout. The docs describe what happens when commands run together
  instead of warning against it.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **`videre config set io-workers N`** (1 to 256) limits how many helper
  threads a videre process keeps for file reads that may block on an
  unresponsive drive. The default is four times the CPU count, clamped to
  32 through 128.

### Changed

- **Hashing no longer has a total time limit.** A large file on a slow but
  working drive keeps hashing as long as bytes arrive, however slowly; a
  file is skipped only when its read returns nothing for 20 seconds, or its
  metadata does not answer within five. `read-rate` no longer affects
  hashing; it still scales the other whole-file reads, such as XMP sidecars.
- **A full or read-only library stops `videre faces` at the first failed
  write**, with one message, instead of one error per photo while it keeps
  detecting the rest of the library.
- **`videre watch` backs off a failing library volume.** After a disk-level
  write error, retries slow from every few seconds to at most the hourly
  maintenance pass, and file events wait for the next retry. The daemon stays
  up, and one clean cycle restores the normal cadence.
- **For crate users:** `videre_core::io_timeout::run_with_timeout` returns
  `Result<T, IoRunError>`, which says whether a call hit its deadline, stopped
  making progress, or was refused because every worker was busy.
  `TimedOutAfter` is replaced by `PathIoError`, and `video_meta::read_file` is
  removed (`read_file_in_progress` is its general form).

### Fixed

- **A stuck drive could pile up blocked threads without limit.** Each timed
  out read left its thread behind. Workers are now bounded per process; when
  every one is held by a stuck read, new files are refused, warned about once,
  and counted on exit, never reported as the drive timing out. `prune` treats
  a refusal as unknown and never deletes a row on it.
- **A staged copy that finished after its caller gave up was left in the
  library's state directory.** It now removes itself.

## [0.47.1] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **Liked files wear a red heart on their thumbnails** in the gallery's tile
  and list views, bottom left. It only shows the state; the heart in the
  lightbox is the one that likes and unlikes, and the thumbnail follows it.
- **The Duplicates page has its header back**: the number of duplicate
  groups, the files in them, and the space the extra copies take.

### Fixed

- **The gallery could stop seeing the library.** After a Recluster preview or
  apply, the next other process to close the library could delete the
  database's write-ahead log while the gallery was still using it. The
  gallery then showed a frozen view of the library, and changes made in it
  from then on could be lost when it stopped. Checking a library's database
  no longer releases the gallery's locks on it.
- **The search box disappeared on the Date, Duplicates and Events pages** of
  a library with embeddings. It now shows on every section.
- **Similar on the grid under the map failed** with nowhere to show its
  results; it now shows them above the grid.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-09-28

### Upgrading

- **A library upgrades itself to schema 4 the first time a writable command
  opens it**, such as `videre scan`. Face IDs are never reused after this,
  so the learning journal can keep referring to faces that were pruned.
  Stop every other videre command running in the library first; the upgrade
  refuses while one holds it. An older videre cannot open an upgraded
  library.

### Added

- **`videre dedupe --edited` finds Google Takeout's edited copies.** Takeout
  exports every edited photo twice, `IMG_1.jpg` and `IMG_1-edited.jpg`, and
  the bytes differ, so dedupe never paired them. `--edited` pairs them by
  name in the same folder; with `--remove` the edits go to the trash and the
  originals stay. An edit is removed only when its original is on disk, and
  edits do not count toward the bulk-deletion guard, so no `--force` is
  needed. `--json --edited` adds `edited_pairs`.
- **A Takeout import counts the edited pairs** and its "Next:" hint
  suggests the `dedupe --edited` commands.
- **The gallery's duplicates page and `dedupe --html --edited`** show each
  original beside its edit.

### Changed

- **`videre prune` removes the faces and face-scan markers of files no
  longer in the library.** Person names and the learning journal stay;
  evidence from removed faces stops counting for training, questions about
  them are withdrawn, and a learned profile trained on them is retired. A
  dry run reports these counts too.
- **`videre locations` groups nearby coordinates into small cells first**,
  a tenth of the radius across (1.5km at the default 15km), and
  coordinates in one cell always share a place. Existing place assignments may shift slightly
  on the next recompute.
- **`videre faces` keeps each HEIC's full-resolution decode in the
  thumbnail cache** as it detects, which the People pages then reuse. The
  cache grows by one full-resolution copy per HEIC processed, as it already
  did with `watch --heic`.

### Fixed

- **`videre locations` could freeze the machine on a large library.** It
  built a distance table over every pair of coordinates, about 5GB at 27,000
  coordinates. It now needs tens of MB and finishes in well under a second
  on the same library size.
- **Face crops on the People pages rendered a HEIC photo once per face.** A
  photo with five faces cost five QuickLook renders, several seconds each.
  The crops now read the cached full-resolution decode, and a photo is
  rendered at most once.
- **Face learning could promote a profile trained on faces that were
  deleted or changed while it trained.** Promotion now checks the training
  run is still current.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- **Face learning is off by default.** Turn it on for a library with
  `"faces": { "learning": true }` in `.videre/gallery.json`. Off, naming,
  moving and dissolving work the same but record no teaching evidence, no
  training runs, and the People page asks no identity questions. Evidence
  recorded earlier is kept, and training resumes from it when learning is
  turned back on.
- **The People toolbar no longer has a Learning updates control.** The
  option is now `faces.learningUpdates` in `gallery.json`, replacing
  `routes.people.learningUpdates`; a saved value under the old key is
  ignored.
- **Face learning trains 10 seconds after the last teaching action**, rather
  than 1.5 seconds after the first, so a burst of naming trains once.

### Fixed

- **Naming a person froze the gallery while face learning trained.** Pages,
  thumbnails and the learning status could wait up to a minute on a library
  with a person of thousands of faces. Training now runs on its own database
  connection and never holds up a request.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- **`videre embed` computes the near-duplicate fingerprint** that
  `dedupe --similar` reads, from the image it already decodes, so fingerprints
  no longer need a separate decode pass. The first `embed` after upgrading also
  fingerprints files that were embedded before and have none: it decodes and
  hashes them without loading the model, and its summary counts them as
  fingerprints added. Fingerprints stored by `scan --similar` are kept.
- **`scan --similar` is deprecated** and does nothing; it still parses so
  scripts do not break, and prints a notice. Run `videre embed` instead.
- **`dedupe --similar` says to run `videre embed`** when the library has no
  fingerprints yet.

### Fixed

- **A rescan erased near-duplicate fingerprints.** Every `scan --force`, and any
  rescan of a changed file without `--similar`, cleared the stored fingerprint.
  A fingerprint is now kept while the file's content is unchanged.
- **The gallery waited 20 seconds on an audio-only video** (such as a Live
  Photo's companion) each time it asked for its poster. It is now skipped at
  once, as `embed` already did.
- **A QuickLook timeout was logged once**, not twice, by `embed` and `faces`,
  and thumbnails, posters and `watch` still log it when they skip a file.
- **HEIC and video files whose names are not valid UTF-8** now convert through
  QuickLook instead of failing.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- **Sort on the Events and Map pages.** Map sorts its photos by date, name,
  size, rating, liked or type; the Events overview sorts events by date,
  number of files, length or name. Each page keeps its own choice in
  `gallery.json`.

### Changed

- **A tidier selection bar.** The bar that acts on a selection now shows the
  count and Clear, then icon buttons: a heart that likes every selected item,
  or unlikes them all when all are already liked; small menus for rating,
  colour label, tag, and keep or reject; rotate left and right; a More menu
  with Copy paths; and Delete last. Results appear briefly above the bar.
- **One settings bar on every page.** A person's page and a cluster's page now
  carry their back link, title, face count and actions in the same toolbar as
  the other pages, and toolbar buttons, links and fields look the same
  everywhere.
- **The Similar images panel sits under the toolbar**, and its button reads
  Close.
- **A rejected gallery request says why.** The People pages show the reason,
  and every rejected request is written to the gallery log as a warning with
  its route and reason.

### Fixed

- **Assigning a cluster failed** when one of its photos had a byte-identical
  copy elsewhere in the library: the cluster and person pages listed that
  photo's faces twice, and the assignment was refused. Each face is now listed
  once.
- **A rotated photo showed unrotated** when its lightbox was reopened or zoomed,
  because the page reused the image it had fetched before the rotation.
  Rotating from the selection bar had the same problem.
- **`embed` with a model that cannot load, or with nothing to do, left an empty
  model database** that `stats` listed as a model. It is now created only once
  a model has loaded and there is work to write, and `prune` removes empty ones.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Select mode in the gallery.** Library, Date, Events and Map get a Select
  toggle: click to select, Shift-click for a range, Escape to clear. A bar
  along the bottom likes, keeps or rejects, rates, labels, tags, untags,
  rotates, copies paths, or moves the selection to the system Trash after a
  confirmation. People singletons use the same bar and gain Shift ranges.
- **Recluster from the People page.** A Recluster row shows the grouping
  values the library uses, previews a regroup without writing anything, and
  applies it. Applied values are saved to `gallery.json` `faces.clustering`,
  and `videre faces` and `videre watch` use them unless a flag overrides them.
- **`stats` reports logs** in its disk use, and `stats --json` now includes
  the type breakdown (`by_type`) and disk use (`disk_use`).

### Changed

- **`watch` keeps leftover faces attached when it regroups**, as `faces`
  always did; its regroup used to skip that pass.
- **Face learning updates are hidden by default** on the People page; a
  toolbar toggle shows them. Its outcomes go to the gallery log, and the
  Recluster row summarises what learning currently contributes.

### Fixed

- **A face named during a regroup keeps its name.** Cluster assignments are
  written in one transaction and never onto a labeled face.
- **`stats` printed its Disk use section twice.**
- **Dependency advisories:** rustls is updated (RUSTSEC-2026-0285) and the
  unmaintained `number_prefix` is no longer pulled in.

### Security

- Workflows pin every action to a commit, keep the job token out of the
  checkout, grant write access only to the release jobs that need it, set
  timeouts on every job, and run `cargo audit` on every change and weekly.


## [0.42.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Release artifacts now report the correct version.** v0.42.0 included the
  changes listed below but was tagged before its version bump was merged, so
  its binaries reported `videre 0.41.0`. v0.42.1 supersedes that release with
  matching binary, crate and tag versions. No library rebuild is needed.


## [0.42.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Gallery settings are saved per library** in `.videre/gallery.json`. The
  Settings page can import, export and reset them. The gallery can reopen at
  the last page visited, and tile view is now the default. Tile dimensions,
  spacing, page size, map radius and People layout can be customized.
- **Library and Date sorting.** Order files by date, name, size, rating, liked
  status or type, in either direction. The choice is saved per library and
  applies to static exports too.

### Changed

- **Events now shows substantial travel trips** instead of one-file events.
  Located photos and their capture times establish a destination; dated videos
  and photos without GPS can join when the photo evidence supports them.
  Nearby stops over several days can form one trip. Local outings are not yet
  detected.
- **Gallery pages share a settings bar.** Library, Date, Events, Duplicates
  and People put their relevant view controls in a consistent place.

### Fixed

- **`fix-dates` only prompts for and changes files whose dates differ** from
  the embedded EXIF date. Already-correct files are left untouched.
- **Concurrent QuickLook previews use separate temporary output**, preventing
  missing video posters when the same file is requested at once.

### Documentation

- The command index is alphabetical, and the mark and tag guides explain how
  to remove values.


## [0.41.0] - 2026-09-24

### Breaking changes

- **The library database structure changed, and existing libraries must be
  rebuilt.** The schema version goes from 2 to 3: `file_hashes.hash` now holds
  the content key described below instead of a hash of the whole file, and
  `file_hashes` gains a `meta_hash` column. Every other table that refers to a
  file by its hash (faces, named people, marks, tags, embeddings) holds keys
  from the old scheme, which match nothing a new scan produces.
- **Libraries built by 0.40.0 or earlier are refused, and there is no
  migration.** Every command stops with a `library_schema` error that names
  the library's `.videre` folder. Remove that folder and run `videre scan` to
  build the library again. Removing it also discards faces, named people,
  marks, tags and embeddings; recreate them with `faces`, `gallery`, `embed`
  and `classify`.
- **Versions cannot share a library.** 0.40.0 refuses a library built by
  0.41.0 just as 0.41.0 refuses an older one, so upgrade every machine and
  process that opens a library (a `watch`, a `gallery`, an MCP client) at the
  same time.
- **Hashes in scripts and exports change.** A `hash` saved from `--json`,
  JSONL output or the gallery's URLs before this release no longer names the
  same file.

### Changed

- **A file's identity ignores its metadata.** The content hash is now BLAKE3
  over the image or media data with EXIF, XMP, comments and similar blocks
  left out, for JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF and DNG, HEIC, MOV and MP4.
  Rotating a photo in the gallery, or fixing its date or location in another
  app, keeps its faces, names, marks, tags and embeddings attached. A new
  `meta_hash` column (and JSONL field) records the metadata separately. A file
  that does not parse, or holds no image or media data, keeps the whole-file
  hash.
- **Duplicate groups can differ in metadata.** `dedupe` now groups copies with
  the same pixels or media data even when their dates or GPS differ, and only
  the kept copy's metadata survives `--remove`. Since the oldest date is kept,
  check dates in `dedupe --html` before removing a copy whose date you
  corrected.
- **Face learning waits instead of failing** when it has too little teaching
  feedback. The People page says what it is waiting for, such as *dissolve 2
  more wrong clusters*, rather than *last run failed*. `GET
  /api/face-learning/status` reports a new `waiting` status with
  `feedback_needed`; `last_error` is kept for real failures, which are now
  also logged.

### Fixed

- **The gallery rotates a photo that has no EXIF** by giving it its first EXIF
  block. A photo whose EXIF exists but cannot be read is still refused, so its
  date and GPS are never replaced by a block holding only the orientation.


## [0.40.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Per-command log files.** Every command now records its errors and warnings
  in `<library>/.videre/logs/<command>.log`, so a failure that scrolled past
  under `watch` or `pipeline` can be read afterwards. Each run writes one `run
  started` line, then its failures: a skipped file names the file, a failed
  `pipeline` or `watch` stage names the stage, and failed `gallery` requests
  and `mcp` tool calls are recorded too. Files are owner-only (`0600`), written
  in the background so a slow or disconnected drive never stalls a command, and
  never created in a library that has not been initialized.
- **Error kinds.** When videre knows why something failed, the log line carries
  a `kind` and a remediation: `source_unavailable`, `permission_denied`,
  `decode_failed`, `quicklook_unavailable`, `model_unavailable`,
  `library_busy`, `library_schema` or `database`.
- **Five log settings**, set per library with `videre config set`:
  `log-level` (`error`, `warn` (default), `info`, `debug`), `log-format`
  (`json` (default) or `text`, which is logfmt), `log-max-size-mb` (default
  10), `log-keep` (default 5) and `log-max-age-days` (default 30). At `info` or
  `debug` a separate `<command>.trace.log` holds the detail, so it can never
  push an error out of the primary file. `debug` records lock decisions, stage
  durations, files skipped after repeated decode failures and thumbnail cache
  hits and misses. The settings affect the files only; the terminal is
  unchanged.
- **`videre status` shows recent problems**: for each command whose latest run
  logged errors or warnings, the counts (errors split by `pipeline` and `watch`
  stage) and the last error with its kind. `--json` carries it under
  `report.logs`. A new guide, *Logging and error handling*, documents all of
  this.

### Changed

- **`videre status --check` also fails when a command's latest run logged an
  error**, which catches failures that leave the pipeline record at `success`,
  such as a stage failing inside `watch`. Warnings such as skipped files never
  fail it.
- **Some terminal messages read slightly differently.** `Warning:` and `Error:`
  prefixes are now lowercase `warning:` and `error:`; a skipped file reads
  `warning: skipping <path>: ...`; a failed stage reads `error: videre watch:
  scan stage: ...`. Scripts matching the old capitalized prefixes need updating.
- **A failure reported as a JSON document with `--json` is no longer repeated on
  stderr**, so stdout and stderr stay clean for tooling. It is still logged.

### Upgrading

- Nothing to do. The database is unchanged, and log files start with the first
  command run after upgrading.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **The library database now enforces its relationships.** Foreign keys are
  switched on for every database connection videre opens. A face's person label
  must name an existing person, a file's location cluster must exist, and
  face-learning detail rows must belong to an existing event or question. A write
  that would break one of these now fails at the statement that made it, instead
  of leaving a dangling reference behind.

### Upgrading

- **Existing libraries upgrade automatically; nothing needs regenerating.** The
  first normal command (`videre stats`, `scan`, `gallery` and so on) upgrades the
  database in place, in a single transaction. If anything unexpected goes wrong,
  the upgrade rolls back and leaves the database exactly as it was.
- **Valid data is kept in full**: files, faces with their embeddings and ids,
  people, tags, marks, classifications, location data, face-learning history,
  and any custom columns, indexes, triggers and views. Embedding databases are
  not touched.
- **Only references that were already broken are repaired**, and each repair is
  printed once on stderr (stdout stays clean, so `--json` output remains valid):
  - A face labelled with a person who no longer exists becomes unassigned. The
    face and its embedding stay; relabel it if you want it back. Face-learning
    evidence for that label is invalidated, and pending questions about it are
    superseded.
  - A file pointing at a location cluster that no longer exists has only that
    link cleared; its coordinates and place name stay. Run `videre locations` to
    rebuild clusters.
  - Face-learning detail rows whose parent event or question is missing are
    removed, since they mean nothing without it.

  A healthy library loses nothing.
- **A read-only open does not upgrade.** A command that opens the library
  read-only refuses an old database until a normal command has upgraded it.
- **There is no way back to an older videre.** Once upgraded, the database
  carries schema version 2, and older videre releases refuse to open it.


## [0.38.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Events in the gallery.** A new Events section groups photos into sessions
  automatically: a gap of more than six hours, or a move of more than five
  kilometers between two located shots, starts a new event. Each card shows the
  place name when the photos carry GPS, the date range and the file count; open
  one to see just that session's photos. Events are computed when the page
  opens, so there is nothing to build or keep up to date.
- **The gallery learns from your face corrections (experimental).** Naming a
  cluster, moving or removing a face, or dissolving a group on the People page
  records local teaching evidence. In the background the gallery trains small,
  interpretable scorers from it and, once one passes the quality gates, asks
  yes/no questions such as "Is this Elena?": Yes names the cluster, No only
  teaches, Skip does neither. A status strip shows whether learning is up to
  date and whether the last candidate was promoted or rejected, and each
  person's page lists the teaching behind them. Grouping itself is unchanged;
  face rows only ever change through your own actions.
- New gallery HTTP endpoints for events (`/api/events`,
  `/api/events/{key}/files`) and face learning (`/api/face-learning/status`,
  questions, answers and the teaching journal), documented in the gallery HTTP
  interface reference.

### Changed

- **`videre gallery` finds a free port on its own.** Without `--port` it starts
  at 7878 and advances to the next free port when one is taken, so a second
  gallery for another library needs no port assigned by hand. An explicit
  `--port` is used exactly and fails if that port is busy.
- **`videre faces --reset` also clears face learning.** It deletes teaching
  events, identity questions and learned profiles along with faces and people,
  and its confirmation prompt now lists how many of each it would delete.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Counter-clockwise rotate in the lightbox.** A second rotate button turns a
  photo 90 degrees anticlockwise, beside the existing clockwise one.
- **Like a photo from the lightbox.** A heart at the top-left of the info panel
  toggles the same `liked` mark `videre mark --like` sets, filling red when
  liked.
- **Search box in the gallery navigation.** It ranks the library semantically
  on the Files page, the same ranking the Similar button uses, and appears only
  when the library has embeddings.

### Fixed

- **Rotating a photo turns its faces with it.** A photo's detected face boxes
  and landmarks are rotated alongside the image, so face thumbnails stay on the
  right faces and keep their people labels instead of cropping the wrong region.
- **PNG rotation now takes effect.** PNG orientation is written as a standard
  `eXIf` chunk that the decoder reads and applies; it was previously stored in a
  text chunk the decoder ignored, so the rotation never showed.
- **The lightbox place link reaches the map.** It now opens the map at the
  location cluster nearest the photo's own coordinates, rather than failing with
  an "unknown location" state because the photo's fine-grained place name never
  matched a cluster.
- **The lightbox scroll wheel no longer zooms.** Zoom is reached by clicking the
  image or the fullscreen button; while zoomed, the wheel pans the enlarged
  image.
- The selected place name under the map is legible again (it was rendering in a
  near-invisible colour on the light background).

### Changed

- **Gallery navigation.** The strip gains the videre wordmark (linking home),
  renames "Files" to "Library", and carries the new search box, at a constant
  height across every page.
- **Home header.** Condensed to the library path, the generated time, and a
  files/embeddings count, aligned to the navigation's left gutter, and dropped
  on the secondary pages where the strip already names the view.
- **Map view.** The selected location and its radius now sit next to the View
  selector; the separate selection band and the "All files" title are gone, and
  the map page no longer shows the tall header.
- **Date view.** A top-level "All Dates" breadcrumb roots the drill-down,
  card labels are centred, the "Browse by date" title is dropped, and spacing
  around the breadcrumb is tidied.
- **Gallery layout polish.** One consistent left gutter across the page, tile
  view gutters matching the list, card Similar buttons pinned to the card
  bottom, and a primary-styled "Show more" button.


## [0.36.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **`videre faces --evaluate` scores the current face clustering against
  confirmed labels.** The command replays grouping over stored embeddings and
  reports pair precision, pair recall, mixed clusters, fragmented identities,
  and the unassigned rate - read-only, model-free, and deterministic.
  `--json` emits the full report; tuning flags (`--eps`, `--merge-sim`, and
  the rest) let you evaluate hypothetical parameter changes without touching
  face state.
- **Decision evidence, identity-balanced sampling, and face learning
  profiles** land as the evaluation foundation for face clustering quality
  work: reconstructable decision evidence with versioned schemas,
  identity-held-out validation folds, Wilson-bound suggestion gates,
  fail-closed profile promotion with atomic activation, and frozen-dataset
  comparison. Nothing in this release changes grouping behavior for labeled
  faces.


## [0.35.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Addressable location drill-down on the map.** Clicking a cluster now opens
  a proximity view at `/map/location/<place>?radius=<km>`: a breadcrumb, a
  radius control that grows or shrinks the media grid to every GPS-bearing file
  within that exact distance (regardless of its original cluster), and real
  URLs that restore the same state on reload, Back, and Forward. Clear, Escape,
  or zooming back to the world returns to the unselected map. An unknown place
  keeps the map and grid working without a selection.

### Changed

- **The map draws real cartography from an offline basemap.** The `/map` plot
  now renders with MapLibre GL JS over a vector basemap - coastlines, land,
  water, and borders - built from OpenStreetMap data, downloaded once per
  machine on first `/map` visit into the shared cache and fully offline at view
  time. An `OpenStreetMap contributors` attribution shows on the map. A machine
  without working WebGL falls back to the previous self-drawn plot, so the
  two-tier clusters, cluster-click filtering, drill-down, and grid never
  regress. This one-time download is a new outbound request, alongside
  `search --location` geocoding; nothing about your library is sent out.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **The gallery grows a `/map` view.** Location clusters plot on a world map
  grouped by continent; zooming in reveals each location cluster, and clicking
  one filters the media grid below to its photos, in List or Tile view. The
  plot draws entirely from the local library database - no map tiles, no map
  library, no outbound requests. A `GET /api/location-clusters` endpoint
  serves the aggregate, and `/api/files` accepts a `cluster=<id>` filter.
- **Location clusters keep themselves current under watch.** A fingerprint
  over the GPS-bearing data gates an automatic recluster in
  `videre watch --location`: pruning, deduplicating, or adding geotagged
  photos reclusters on the next reconcile instead of leaving
  [`videre locations`](/commands/locations/) silently stale. A manual
  `--radius` is respected by the watcher.

### Changed

- **`videre status` reports stale location clusters.** When the GPS data has
  changed since the last recompute - including the prune and dedupe cases
  that leave no unassigned row to count - the locations stage names the
  staleness and the command that refreshes it.
- **The location recompute core moved to videre-core**, shared by the
  standalone command and the watcher.


## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **`videre faces --reset` provides a guarded full rebuild of face data.** It
  reports how many faces and people will be removed, asks for confirmation,
  clears detections, labels, grouping state, and face decode failures, then
  reruns detection and grouping. `--yes` supports deliberate scripted use, and
  `--dry-run` reports the impact without changing the library.

### Changed

- **Labeled faces are frozen during every automatic grouping pass.** Running
  `faces --recluster`, changing its tuning parameters, or allowing watch to
  regroup new detections no longer moves named faces or changes a person's
  membership and primary face. Removing a person returns those faces to the
  unassigned pool so they can be grouped again.

### Fixed

- **`videre faces --dry-run` is now fully write-free.** It does not create or
  migrate face tables, record pipeline runs, install interrupt tracking, or
  import XMP labels while evaluating the requested work.
- **Filter-only search JSON describes mark and tag filters.** The reported
  query value now includes ratings, picks, colour labels, likes, and tags along
  with the other composed filters.

### Removed

- **`videre faces --reprocess` has been replaced by `--reset`.** The old flag
  did not clearly communicate that starting over deletes named people and face
  labels. Use `videre faces --reset`, review the reported counts, and confirm
  the rebuild instead.

### Internal

- Expanded deterministic coverage for face resets, reclustering parameters,
  frozen labels, primary faces, and composed search filters without requiring
  model inference.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **`videre watch` now responds to live filesystem events.** New and changed
  media are processed within seconds instead of waiting for the next polling
  interval. Event bursts are coalesced using the configurable
  `watch-debounce-ms` window, while startup, dropped-event, and periodic
  reconciliations keep the library correct when events are unavailable or
  incomplete. Face detection stays on the fast path, and global face
  reclustering runs only when new detections require it.
- **The gallery lightbox can enter fullscreen for photos.** The navigation and
  information controls remain available, and closing the lightbox also exits
  fullscreen.
- **Drilled-down date pages show how many items they contain.** Counts are
  available on direct year, month, day, and custom-range URLs.

### Changed

- **Gallery Tile view thumbnails are sharper and use square corners.** Tile and
  grid views now request 480-pixel thumbnails for better rendering on HiDPI
  displays.
- **The New Person action focuses the name field immediately,** so typing can
  begin without an extra click.
- **Commands in `videre --help` are listed alphabetically.**

### Removed

- **`videre watch --interval` has been removed.** Watch scheduling is now
  driven by filesystem events and internal reconciliation. Scripts passing the
  old option must remove it.

### Internal

- Added a Chromium Playwright suite for gallery routes and interactions, and
  enabled it in pull request and `main` CI.
- Expanded unit and integration coverage for image serving, thumbnail caching,
  XMP reconciliation, watch scheduling, and filesystem event handling.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- **The gallery offers a Tile view on the Files and Date tabs.** Photos and
  videos appear in rows sized to their aspect ratios. Switch between List and
  Tile using the View selector; your browser remembers the choice. List remains
  the default. Tile layout adapts when resizing the window or loading more
  files, and supports the existing lightbox navigation.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-09-17

### Deprecated

- **`scan --retry-incomplete` is now a no-op that prints a deprecation notice.**
  `scan` has been incremental by default for a while, so the flag no longer
  changes what is processed. It is still accepted so existing scripts do not
  error, but it does nothing.

### Fixed

- **`dedupe --remove` now prunes the removed copies from the library.** Moving
  duplicate files to the trash left their rows in the database, so the gallery,
  `stats`, and search kept showing a ghost of every removed copy until you ran
  `videre prune` by hand. The removal now runs that prune itself once it
  succeeds, so the database matches the disk in the same command.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **The gallery lightbox info panel is reorganised into two columns.** The file
  facts (filename, date, size, then place name) sit on the left, each on its own
  row with a small icon, and the people in the photo sit on the right; a file
  with no labeled faces uses a single full-width column. The media and panel now
  use the normal cursor and the panel text is selectable, so the filename can be
  copied.

### Fixed

- **The "new person" controls on the face-labeling page align to the bottom of
  both cluster and singleton cards** instead of sitting inconsistently.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **The gallery lightbox has prev/next navigation.** Arrow buttons at the
  lightbox edges and the Left/Right arrow keys step through the items without
  closing it. The walk covers every view (files, duplicates, date, similar)
  and the static `--html` export, skips tiles hidden inside collapsed groups,
  stops at the first item, and stepping past the last loaded item pulls in
  the next page automatically, so reaching the end no longer needs "Show
  more". A playing clip stops when you step to a photo, so its audio does not
  linger behind the lightbox.
- **The lightbox has an info panel under the media.** It shows the labeled
  people (the whole card links to the person's page), the place name when the
  file has GPS, and the filename, size, and date in human-readable form,
  formatted from the stored wall-clock string with no timezone shift. The
  panel is always shown, including when a file has no people or location data
  yet.

## [0.28.6] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Gallery video tiles are now static poster frames with a play badge, and the
  clip plays when you click it.** On macOS the poster is extracted through
  QuickLook, which renders it display-oriented, so rotation-carrying iPhone
  clips that browsers drew sideways now appear upright; the video plays in the
  lightbox on click. Off macOS, tiles stay inline video players, also badged.
- **`videre watch`'s location stage is now recorded in the pipeline table as
  `location-names`.** `videre status` and `stats` reported the stage as never
  run even after watch had resolved thousands of coordinates; it now shows its
  last run like any other stage. It is deliberately distinct from `locations`,
  the standalone clustering recompute.

### Fixed

- **A sized gallery request for a video no longer reads the whole file into
  memory.** `/api/files/<hash>/raw?size=` returned the entire video with a
  video mime type; it now returns the poster image.
- **`videre status` reports locations and fix-dates coverage correctly.**
  Locations are counted by cluster assignment rather than place name (place
  names are separate metadata that does not gate clustering), and fix-dates
  compares timestamps as instants, so equivalent timezone-offset
  representations count as up to date instead of as outstanding work.

### Internal

- **Clippy now gates CI** (`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
  warnings`): a new lint fails the build rather than accumulating unnoticed.
  The existing warnings were cleared, and `make lint-linux` runs the same gate
  for the Linux configuration in Docker.
- **CI probes the aarch64 install path** without the repo's fp16 override, so
  the job turns red the day that workaround becomes unnecessary and stays green
  until then.
- Documentation and workflow updates.

## [0.28.5] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **`videre status` no longer counts undecodable files as outstanding.** A file
  that `embed` or `faces` has given up decoding (after two failures) was still
  reported as outstanding, so `status` kept suggesting a command that now
  deliberately skips it. Such files are shown separately as "skipped as
  undecodable" instead, and the `--json` output carries a `skipped` count per
  stage. `embed`/`faces --reprocess` retries them.

### Fixed

- **The gallery stops re-running QuickLook on a HEIC that keeps failing to
  convert.** Only successful conversions were cached, so a corrupt or
  unconvertible HEIC re-ran the expensive, sometimes-hanging conversion on every
  thumbnail request. It is now refused after two failures within a gallery run;
  starting the gallery again clears those records, so a file that failed only
  transiently is retried.

## [0.28.4] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Files that repeatedly fail to decode are no longer retried on every run.**
  A file that hangs QuickLook or is otherwise undecodable produced nothing and
  was recorded nowhere, so `videre embed` and `videre faces` (and every `videre
  watch` cycle) re-paid its multi-second timeout forever. Such a file is now
  recorded and skipped after it has failed twice; a single transient failure
  still retries, and any success clears the record. `embed`/`faces --reprocess`
  retries skipped files.
- **`videre dedupe --similar` no longer groups unrelated files by a flat frame.**
  A fade-in, letterboxed opener, or solid title card produces a fingerprint with
  almost no set bits (or almost nothing but set bits), and any two such frames
  collided regardless of content, chaining unrelated media into one bogus group.
  Fingerprints at those extremes are now excluded from similarity grouping;
  exact copies are still caught by content-hash duplicate detection. File size
  plays no part in the comparison, since a genuine re-encode routinely halves
  the file.

## [0.28.3] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Face-labeling actions that target something that no longer exists now
  report failure instead of a false success.** Assigning a face, resetting a
  face, ungrouping a cluster, or setting a primary face in `videre gallery`
  went through write handlers that ignored how many rows they changed. A write
  that matched nothing returned success, so the labeling page reported the
  action worked when it had done nothing (for example labeling a face that was
  already deleted in another tab). These now return a 404 the page can act on.
  Assigning a batch of faces is all-or-nothing: if any face id is missing, the
  whole assignment rolls back rather than applying part of it and claiming
  success. Deleting a person stays idempotent, since a person can legitimately
  have no confirmed faces.

## [0.28.2] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **`videre pipeline` now classifies in the same run it embeds.** Coverage was
  read once, before embed ran, so classify saw zero embeddings and skipped
  itself, leaving a freshly embedded library unclassified until the next run.
  Coverage is now re-read before each stage, so classify sees the vectors embed
  just produced.
- **No more "interrupt handler already registered" warning from `videre
  pipeline`.** The Ctrl-C handler is installed once per process and retargeted at
  the stage currently running, instead of each stage trying to register its own.

### Changed

- **`videre pipeline` and `videre status` no longer show a guessed duration.**
  Advance time estimates were fabricated from per-item constants and were wrong
  by up to 40x depending on hardware, which read as a warning rather than an
  estimate. They now show the exact item count and mark the heavy stages
  (embed, classify) as "intensive" instead. A duration is shown only when it can
  be measured from a real prior run; until per-run item counts are recorded,
  that means the count and the "intensive" marker carry the signal.

## [0.28.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Gallery: the Similar button no longer appears when the library has no
  embeddings.** The in-page Similar search ranks against embedding vectors, so
  on a scanned-but-never-embedded library it could only fail with a generic
  "Search failed". The button is now hidden until the library has embeddings, so
  a control that cannot work is not offered; run `videre embed` to enable it.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **`videre pipeline`: one command to bring a library fully current.** It runs
  the stages in dependency order (scan, then faces, embed, classify, locations),
  each one incremental, and exits. It prints a plan with per-stage outstanding
  counts and an approximate cost, then confirms before the expensive `embed` and
  `classify` stages (`--yes` skips the prompt, `--skip <stage>[,<stage>]` opts a
  stage out). `--fix-dates` and `--export` add their opt-in stages; `--dry-run`
  shows the plan without doing work; `--json` emits a structured run report. It
  is the action counterpart to `videre status`, sharing one staleness model so
  the two never disagree about what "current" means.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- **Reclustering keeps the faces you have already labeled.** A recluster pass
  now excludes confirmed, labeled faces from the clustering set, so re-running
  face grouping (including `watch`'s periodic recluster) leaves the people you
  have named where they are instead of reshuffling them; only unconfirmed,
  unlabeled faces get new cluster assignments.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **`videre dedupe --remove` deletes duplicates for you, safely.** videre
  moves the duplicate copies to the system trash itself (recoverable, never
  `rm`), so paths containing spaces are handled correctly. The old
  `videre dedupe | xargs trash` idiom splits every path on its spaces and
  mishandles Google Takeout exports. `--remove` asks before deleting (`--yes`
  to skip), previews with `--dry-run`, refuses an implausibly large deletion
  without `--force`, and removes only exact duplicates. For scripting,
  `--print0` prints the paths NUL-delimited for a space-safe `| xargs -0`.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **`videre status`: a `git status` for your library.** One read-only command
  answering: is the library up to date (per-stage coverage with what remains
  and the command that closes each gap), did every tracked command finish
  well, is `videre watch` alive and when was its last cycle, and what should
  you run next with an approximate duration. `--json` for scripts and agents;
  `--check` exits nonzero only when a run failed or crashed. `videre watch`
  now records a heartbeat each cycle so liveness is visible.

### Changed

- **`videre stats` is pure inventory.** Its pipeline-status block and
  `--check` moved to the new `videre status`, so the two surfaces cannot tell
  different stories about the same runs. Scripts using `stats --check` switch
  to `status --check`.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **`videre embed --reprocess`.** Re-embeds every eligible image, including
  ones that already have a vector under the model, mirroring
  `faces --reprocess` and `classify --reprocess`. This is the recovery path
  for libraries whose embeddings were computed before the decode fix below.

### Changed

- **Faces and search now see the photo the way you see it.** Files stored
  rotated on disk (an EXIF orientation tag other than 1, common in exports
  and edits) were previously decoded on the stored pixel canvas. Face
  detection ran degraded on the sideways image, face embeddings described a
  rotated crop and carried no identity, and text search embedded a sideways
  scene. Every decode of a source file now reads the orientation tag and
  applies it, through one shared helper. New face rows record
  `faces.oriented = 1`; rows written by older versions are not healed by
  upgrading, so see [troubleshooting](https://docs.videre.sh/reference/troubleshooting/)
  for recovery recipes, including one that repairs only the affected files
  without touching your face labels.
- **Face grouping recovers more of a person by default.** The attach pass
  (`--attach-sim`), which lets an ungrouped face join the group holding its
  nearest face, is on by default at 0.40 instead of off. Measured on a
  labelled library, 29 of 44 stray photos of one person had a match of 0.40
  or better inside their own group, while confirmed-different people never
  reach that. The sharpness floor (`--min-blur`) drops from 100 to 80,
  admitting soft-but-readable faces of real people; the mixed junk cluster
  the gate exists to prevent sits below 75 and stays excluded.

### Fixed

- **Gallery previews now honor embedded EXIF orientation.** Sized JPEG and
  other browser-raster previews previously resized the stored pixel matrix and
  discarded its orientation tag while encoding the cache entry, so portrait
  photos appeared sideways even though Finder and the full original displayed
  them correctly. Orientation is now applied before resize, and versioned
  raster cache entries bypass previews produced by the old renderer without
  invalidating HEIC conversions.

## [0.25.36] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **`watch` no longer re-clusters faces on every cycle.** The faces stage ran
  the global face-clustering pass (an O(n^2) step over every face in the
  library) once per cycle regardless of whether the cycle detected anything new,
  so an idle library re-clustered its entire face set every interval for no
  change. Clustering now runs only when a cycle actually detects new faces; an
  idle cycle does none. A cycle that adds a face still does one full recluster.

## [0.25.35] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **XMP metadata is now read incrementally.** Scan and watch previously re-read
  every file's XMP on every run, and for a file with no sidecar read its entire
  contents to search for an embedded packet, so a repeat scan or each watch
  cycle paid the full cost even when nothing had changed. A file's XMP is now
  read the first time it is scanned and again only when the media or its sidecar
  changes; an unchanged file is skipped, so a repeat scan reads no metadata at
  all. A sidecar edited in another tool is detected from its modification time
  and re-read without touching the media. `--xmp file` and `--xmp newest` still
  reconcile every file. A new `xmp_sidecar_mtime` column tracks each file's
  sidecar state and is added automatically on the next scan.

## [0.25.34] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **`scan` no longer looks frozen after the progress bar reaches 100%.** Once
  hashing finishes, `scan` reads XMP for every file in the library (the
  whole-library reconcile), a phase that previously ran with no indicator and
  can take minutes on a large library, even on an otherwise unchanged rescan.
  It now announces the phase (`Reading metadata for N file(s)`) and shows its
  own progress bar, so a long run reads as working rather than hung. `watch`'s
  scan stage does the same.
- **`videre gallery` thumbnails no longer fail to load on a large library.**
  The grid served the full-resolution original for every raster tile (only
  HEIC was downscaled), so a big library, especially on a slow or external
  drive, saturated the browser's handful of connections with multi-megabyte
  transfers and most tiles never loaded. The grid now requests a 240px
  thumbnail that the server renders and caches per content hash (the lightbox
  gets 1200px, the link still opens the full original), so each tile is tens of
  kilobytes and a reopen is served from cache.

## [0.25.33] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **`scan` is incremental by default.** A file whose recorded row is already
  current (unchanged size and mtime, type identified, and a perceptual hash
  present when `--similar` is used) is skipped instead of re-read and re-hashed,
  so re-scanning a large library that has barely changed is a cheap walk rather
  than a full re-read of every byte. New and changed files are still processed.
  `--force` re-reads and re-hashes everything; `--retry-incomplete` becomes a
  deprecated no-op alias of the new default. `watch`'s scan stage is incremental
  the same way, and `fix-dates` now records the mtime it writes so it does not
  trigger a full re-hash on the next scan. A sidecar-only change (re-rating in
  another tool without touching the media file) is not detected by an
  incremental scan; run `videre scan --force` to pick those up.
- **Directory-local libraries.** Every command now resolves its library from
  the working directory (or an explicit `--library <DIR>`), operating on the
  `.videre` state directory at that root. A library is fully self-contained:
  its database, per-model embedding stores, thumbnail and geocoding caches, and
  command locks all live under its own root, so two libraries never share
  state and running a command in the wrong directory can no longer touch an
  unrelated library.
- **`scan` and `watch` take no positional directory or `--path`.** They walk
  the selected library's own root; to work on a different tree, select a
  different library. The database-backed commands (`search`, `embed`, `faces`,
  `classify`, `mark`, `export`, `tag`) keep `--path`, which is now a filter
  confined to a subtree of the library and rejected if it escapes the root.
- **JSONL is an explicit export.** `videre export --jsonl` writes
  `.videre/hashes.jsonl` as an atomic snapshot of the selected files; `scan`
  no longer streams JSONL.

### Added

- **Mark and tag filters compose across the command surface.** The
  `--rating`/`--pick`/`--label`/`--like`/`--tag` filters, previously accepted
  only by `search`, now narrow `export`, `classify`, `embed`, `faces` and `tag`
  as well, and `mark` gains `--tag`. So you can `embed --like`, `faces --tag
  portraits`, `export --label Green --xmp`, or `tag --add printed --tag beach`.
  On `mark` the mark flags remain setters, so its only mark/tag filter is
  `--tag` (`mark --tag vacation --rating 5`); on `tag` the setters are the
  separate `--add`/`--remove`, so every filter is free to narrow. `search` now
  builds its selection through the same shared assembler as every other
  command, so the vocabularies cannot drift; its `--help` and behaviour are
  unchanged.

### Removed

- **Global library resolution.** The `--db` flag, the `VIDERE_HOME`
  environment variable, and the persisted `default_db` / `default_path`
  config keys are gone, along with the built-in fallback database path. A
  command with no `--library` uses the working directory rather than a global
  default, and `--db` is rejected at parse time.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Code examples use matching light and dark syntax themes.** Documentation
  builds now force content regeneration and fail when generated pages reference
  missing local CSS or JavaScript assets.

### Changed

- **The workflow pipeline is easier to follow.** Its tree now uses consistent
  branch characters and shows where gallery views, marking, tagging, cleanup,
  and metadata export fit into the processing sequence.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Gallery date routes** added `/date/YYYY`, `/date/YYYY/MM`, `/date/YYYY/MM/DD`
- **Gallery date filtering** added `/date?from=...&to=...` and `/api/files?view=date&from=...&to=....`
- from is inclusive, to is exclusive, partial dates normalize to the first day.
- Invalid path dates return 404; invalid query/range dates return 400.
- Live date cards now use real route links; static HTML exports keep their single-file behavior.
- Updated endpoint manifest and Gallery HTTP docs.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Presence filters.** Row-backed commands can now select files by metadata
  availability with `--has <field>` and `--missing <field>`. The first fields
  are `gps` and `date`, and both repeated flags and comma-separated values are
  accepted: `--missing gps --missing date` and `--missing gps,date` mean the
  same thing. `search`, `embed`, `faces`, `classify`, `mark`, `tag` and
  `export --xmp` support the new filters; path-backed `scan` and `watch` do
  not, because they have not read row metadata yet.
- **MCP search can use presence filters too.** The `search` tool accepts `has`
  and `missing` arrays, using the same `gps` and `date` fields as the CLI.

## [0.22.2] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **The section nav strip now appears on the cluster and person pages.** The
  `/people/cluster/{id}` and `/people/person/{name}` pages were missing the
  Files/Duplicates/Date/People navigation that every other gallery page carries.
- **The person page's Save button is a primary button now,** with spacing before
  it, matching the rest of the labeling UI.
- **Date-view cards inset their thumbnail** with padding instead of running it
  flush to the card's top edge.

## [0.22.1] - 2026-08-31

### Removed

- **`videre_core::home::resolve_db_in` is deleted.** It resolved a database from
  a home's `config.toml` alone, ignoring `VIDERE_HOME`, which is a meaning almost
  no caller wants. The one caller that used it (the `videre config` output) was
  already switched to the full-precedence `resolve_db`, and nothing else in the
  workspace called it. Removing a `pub` item from a published crate is why the
  0.21 to 0.22 step is a minor bump rather than a patch; no command-line
  behaviour changes.

### Fixed

- **The gallery `/people` labeling page no longer overlaps the top chrome.** The
  People section was a full-height fixed sidebar that painted over the nav bar
  and header down the right edge. It is now a column inside the content area,
  below the shared chrome: a sticky right-hand pane by default, a full-width
  strip at the top in "People: Top" mode, with a background matching the page.
  The drag hint on each cluster and singleton card reads "Drag on a person to
  assign", and the section headings have room before their first thumbnail.
- **Removed the redundant `/people` toolbar and the "Save & Close" button.** The
  band duplicated the header's people/clusters/singletons counts, and "Save &
  Close" only stopped the server, which every labeling action already saves the
  moment it is made. The layout toggle moved into the People heading as a primary
  button; the server still stops with Ctrl-C.
- **Cluster and singleton faces can now open their original photo.** On the
  cluster detail page each face links to the full image in a new tab, matching
  the person page; on the labeling page each singleton gets a magnifier that
  opens its original in a new tab without disturbing multi-select or
  drag-to-assign.

## [0.21.9] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- **Internal restructure of the gallery code.** The oversized
  `commands/report.rs`, named for a command removed in 0.20.0, is split into a
  shared `render` module and a `commands/gallery/server.rs` HTTP server, and the
  page renderer now takes a single `RenderSet`. No change to behaviour, output,
  or the command-line interface.

## [0.21.8] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Gallery HTTP interface reference.** The docs now describe the local HTTP
  routes served while `videre gallery` is running, including page routes, JSON
  endpoints, request bodies, response examples and byte-serving endpoints. A new
  docs guard checks that every route in `gallery_endpoints.json` appears in the
  reference page, so route changes and docs changes stay paired.

## [0.21.7] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **The gallery HTTP API is now resource-oriented REST.** RPC-style verbs in the
  path (`POST /api/new-person`, `/api/set-full-name`, `/api/dissolve-cluster`,
  ...) become methods on plural-noun resources: `POST /api/people`,
  `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/people/{name}`, `PUT /api/people/{name}/faces`,
  `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/faces/{id}`, `GET /api/faces/{id}/image` and `/original`,
  `GET`/`DELETE /api/clusters/{id}`, `PATCH /api/files/{hash}`,
  `GET /api/files/{hash}/raw`, `GET /api/locations`. The router, the endpoint
  manifest, and the gallery frontend change together. Internal only: no CLI, MCP,
  or `--html` change, and the gallery ships in the same binary so there is no
  external API to break.

### Added

- A build-time guard that the gallery frontend JS only calls endpoints declared
  in `gallery_endpoints.json`, so a stale `fetch` to a renamed route fails the
  build (the frontend counterpart of the docs-route guard).

## [0.21.6] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Updated the transitive `chacha20` dependency from the yanked 0.10.1 to 0.10.2.
  No behaviour change; it clears a yank warning on `cargo publish`.

## [0.21.5] - 2026-08-28

### Removed

- **Dead `videre report` routing.** The gallery server carried a labeling-only
  configuration that no command had constructed since `videre report` was removed
  in 0.20.0: `serve_gallery` is the only entry point and always runs as
  `videre gallery`, so the `else` branch (and its `/faces`, bare `/cluster/{id}`
  and `/person/{name}` routes) was unreachable. Removed it along with the now-dead
  `handle_report` handler and the `show_report`/`report_all`/`report_by_date`
  state it needed. No user-facing change; the `--html` export and every live
  gallery route are unaffected. The gallery endpoint manifest drops to the real
  routes, and its per-route `gallery` flag is gone.

## [0.21.4] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **The gallery HTTP endpoints have one source of truth.** A new
  `src/commands/gallery_endpoints.json` manifest lists every route `videre
  gallery` serves, and a test asserts it matches the router's `.route(...)` calls
  exactly in both directions: add, remove or move a route without updating the
  manifest and the build fails. A second test asserts the docs never name a
  gallery route the server does not serve (the route counterpart of the existing
  flag guard), which the `/cluster` -> `/people/cluster` move in 0.20.5 would have
  caught.

## [0.21.3] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Free-form tags.** A new `videre tag --add`/`--remove` command tags photos by
  content hash (so tags follow a photo across duplicates and moves), and `--tag`
  filters everywhere `search` filters, ANDed and composing with every other
  predicate: `videre search --tag beach --person "Ayşe" --rating 4`.
- **Tags round-trip through XMP.** `scan` reads `dc:subject` keywords from a
  sidecar or embedded packet and stores them as tags (additive, so it ignores the
  `--xmp` precedence), and `videre export --xmp` writes your tags back out as
  `dc:subject`, so digiKam, Lightroom and darktable see them. Verified against a
  real exiftool-produced sidecar. This closes the keyword read-back loop from the
  XMP portability work.

### Notes

- A tag is one flat string; hierarchical keywords (`lr:hierarchicalSubject`) are
  not modelled, and the gallery does not filter by tag.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Import face names from XMP.** `videre faces` now reads MWG face regions from
  a photo's `.xmp` sidecar or embedded packet and assigns the names to the faces
  it detects, matching each region to a face by bounding-box overlap. A name you
  gave a face in digiKam or Lightroom imports into videre. This is the read side
  of `videre export --xmp`.
- **`--xmp db|file|newest` on `faces`.** Decides who wins when a face already has
  a name: `db` (default) fills only unnamed faces, `file` lets the sidecar
  override, `newest` is reserved. The default comes from the `xmp_precedence`
  config key, the same one `scan` uses for ratings.

### Fixed

- **Image dimensions are recorded even without EXIF.** `scan` now falls back to
  the image header for width/height when the EXIF tags are absent (AI-generated
  images, screenshots, many PNGs). Without this, XMP face regions could neither
  be exported nor imported for such files, since both normalize pixel boxes
  against the dimensions.

### Notes

- Both region encodings are read: videre's attribute-form `stArea` and the nested
  element form exiftool and other tools write. Verified against a real
  exiftool-produced sidecar fixture.
- Names import while faces are detected; use `--reprocess` to import into a
  library whose faces were detected earlier.
- End-to-end coverage: a model-gated test detects a face in a real image, imports
  a region name onto it, and confirms `search --person` finds it.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **`videre export --xmp`: portable labels beyond marks.** Writes named face
  regions (MWG `mwg-rs:Regions`, the format digiKam and Lightroom read),
  resolved location (`Iptc4xmpCore:Location`), category keyword (`dc:subject`)
  and the existing rating/label into `.xmp` sidecars beside each photo. The
  selection flags scope it exactly like `search`, and it prints `N of M`. So a
  name you assigned in videre shows up as a named face in Lightroom or digiKam.

- **Merging, not clobbering.** Export merges into an existing sidecar, replacing
  only the fields videre owns and preserving everything else verbatim, including
  another tool's keywords and develop settings, in both element and attribute
  form. Re-exporting is idempotent. The MWG region shape was validated against
  exiftool, the reference parser those tools rely on.

- **Opt-in `watch` export stage.** `videre watch --export-xmp` keeps sidecars
  current each cycle while you work in another tool; `videre config set
  export-xmp-on-watch true` makes it always-on. Never defaults on, and merges
  like the command. `videre mark --export-xmp` now shares the same writer.

### Changed

- Exported sidecars use element form (`<xmp:Rating>4</xmp:Rating>`) rather than
  attribute form, so they carry the richer face-region and keyword structure.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Photo marks: rating, pick, colour label, and like.** A new `videre mark`
  command sets any of them on a selection (the same filters as `search`) or on
  paths piped in, and the same names filter everywhere: `videre search --rating
  4 --pick keep --label Red --like` composes with every existing filter, in the
  CLI, over MCP, and in the gallery. Marks are keyed by content hash, so they
  follow a photo across duplicates and moves.

- **XMP interchange.** `scan` and `watch` read `xmp:Rating` and `xmp:Label` from
  a sidecar or the embedded packet, so a library already rated in Lightroom or
  digiKam arrives with its ratings intact. A `--xmp db|file|newest` flag (config
  key `xmp_precedence`, default `db`) decides who wins when both carry a mark,
  and `videre mark --export-xmp` writes portable sidecars back out. Pick and
  like have no XMP standard and stay in videre's database.

- **Gallery marks over HTTP.** `POST /api/mark` writes marks and `/api/files`
  returns them, through the same core the CLI uses. The visible thumbnail UI is
  tracked separately.

- **`videre stats`** now reports a Marks line, and `videre prune` drops marks
  whose photo is gone from every path, the same orphan rule as embeddings and
  thumbnails.

## [0.20.10] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **`videre prune` rewrote every row on every run.** The timestamp sync selected
  only `path`, so the stored `modified_at` was never read and every file that
  existed was marked for syncing. The reported count meant "rows whose file
  exists" rather than "rows that changed", so a run on an unchanged library
  reported the whole library as synced and a second run said exactly the same.

  It now compares against the stored value and syncs only what differs. After
  `videre fix-dates` changes 9 files, prune reports 9 rather than the whole
  library, which is the number that confirms what happened. `videre watch
  --prune` is the larger beneficiary: it ran this every cycle, taking the single
  WAL writer lock once per row and printing a line per file, for no change.

## [0.20.9] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **`videre config` reported a database no command would open.** With
  `VIDERE_HOME` set and that home's `config.toml` naming a different `db`, the
  `resolved db:` line showed the configured path while every command opened
  `<home>/hashes.db`, then failed with "no database found" against a path
  `config` had never mentioned. `config` resolved through `resolve_db_in`, which
  reads config alone and does not apply the `VIDERE_HOME` rule; it now uses the
  same `resolve_db` the commands call, and prints the same note when an explicit
  home overrides a configured `default_db`.

## [0.20.8] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Dependencies updated to their latest semver-compatible releases, 89 packages
  in total. No behaviour change is intended; major version upgrades were held
  back to be evaluated separately.

## [0.20.7] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- **Face quality is judged on the face, not on the library.** `videre faces` held
  out low-quality faces by comparing each one to the average of every face in the
  library. On a personal library that average largely *is* the most photographed
  person, so the check discarded exactly the faces most worth grouping: measured
  against a labelled library, it blocked 15 photos of the owner, several matching
  a face already in their group almost exactly.

  Two per-face measurements replace it, both previously computed and thrown away:

  - **Sharpness** (`--min-blur`, default 100), the variance of the Laplacian of
    the aligned crop. Faces that grouped had a median of 894; faces left
    ungrouped, 182.
  - **Alignment** (`--max-landmark-error`, default 7), how far the five detected
    landmarks are from being a face shape. When they are wrong, the crop handed
    to the model is a mangled image and the fingerprint describes the mangling,
    so such faces resemble each other and form a group that looks like a person.

  Measured on two libraries with per-cluster ground truth: **better recall and
  better precision than the previous defaults on both**, and the mixed 33-face
  cluster that forms with no quality gate at all does not appear.

  `--max-generic-sim` remains as a fallback for faces recorded before sharpness
  was measured, so an existing library is unaffected until `videre faces
  --reprocess` re-records them.

### Added

- **`--attach-sim`** (default 1, off): a second pass where an ungrouped face
  joins the group holding its nearest face. Grouping asks a face to resemble the
  *average* of a group, which someone photographed over many years fails even
  when three members match them almost exactly. It runs after grouping and can
  never merge two groups.
- `faces.det_score` and `faces.blur` are recorded. Both were computed and
  discarded on every run.

### Fixed

- **Finishing an action in the labeling UI dropped you on the file list.**
  Removing a person, assigning a cluster and dissolving a cluster all redirected
  to `/`, which is the **Files** view. 0.20.5 fixed the back *link* at the top of
  those pages and missed the redirects, so the link went to the right place while
  every action that completed the page still left labeling.

## [0.20.6] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The People drop zone shared the top of the page with the nav bar.** Both were
  `position: sticky; top: 0`, so the element you drag a cluster onto and the
  element you navigate with occupied the same space, making the labeling UI's
  main interaction unusable. A regression from 0.20.4, which gave every page the
  same chrome; before it, `/people` had no nav and the strip had the top to
  itself.

  People now defaults to the right-hand sidebar, which competes with nothing. The
  **People: Top** toggle still works and now sticks *below* the nav rather than
  over it, so both layouts are usable. The layout is only stored when you choose
  one, so an existing choice is left alone.

## [0.20.5] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The back link from a cluster or person page left the labeling UI.** Both
  pages hardcoded `href="/"`, which since 0.20.0 is the **Files** view, so "Back
  to labeling" dropped you on the file grid. It returns to `/people` now, and
  says "Back to people", which is what the nav calls that section.

- **Cluster and person pages now live under `/people`.** They sat at the root as
  `/cluster/<id>` and `/person/<name>`, so the URL gave no hint which section you
  were in. They are `/people/cluster/<id>` and `/people/person/<name>`.

  Neither path is hardcoded: both are derived from where the labeling UI actually
  lives, because a labeling-only server puts it at `/` and has no `/people` at
  all.

## [0.20.4] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Duplicate groups have their own route, `/duplicates`.** They used to share
  `/` with the file list, so the page everyone lands on grew with the number of
  duplicates in the library: groups are inlined rather than fetched, measured at
  **989 bytes per group**, so a library with 50,000 of them carried ~49 MB on
  its default page. `/` now shows files and nothing else.

  A duplicates page with no duplicates says so, rather than rendering a header
  and nothing else.

### Fixed

- **`/people` failed on any library that had never run `videre faces`.** `scan`
  creates `file_hashes`, `people` and `pipeline_runs`; the `faces` table arrives
  with the first detection run, so querying it before then failed with "no such
  table". The server returned 500 with an empty body and the page reported
  `Unexpected end of JSON input` across the top of the labeling UI.

  Nothing detected is a state, not a failure. It returns an empty list now, and
  the page says what to run.

  Every existing test seeded a faces table, so none of them described a library
  in the state every library starts in.

- **The page-size test could not see this.** Every fixture it seeded had unique
  hashes, so it had zero duplicate groups and measured a page that was clean for
  the wrong reason. It now seeds duplicates, which is what showed that
  `/duplicates` is still over the ceiling at 920 KB.

## [0.20.3] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **The gallery searches on the server, and "Similar" works at any library
  size.** It used to switch itself off above 24 MB of vectors, which is every
  library big enough to want it: the page did the ranking, so it had to download
  every embedding first, and on a 70,601-file library that was 134 MB it refused
  to send.

  A new `/api/search` ranks either a text query or an example already in the
  library, and returns a ranking rather than rows, since the client already
  fetches rows by hash. It is the third caller of the seam `videre search` and
  the MCP server share, so all three rank identically by construction.

  Measured on that library: **0.21s per query** once the model is loaded, and
  the first search pays ~2.3s to load it. Nothing is loaded until someone
  searches, so browsing never touches the model cache.

### Changed

- **The `Embedded` count is shown again on large libraries.** It came from the
  function that loaded every vector, which gave up above the size cap, so the
  header quietly showed nothing on exactly the libraries with the most embedded
  files. It is a `COUNT(*)` now.

### Removed

- **The page no longer carries embeddings at all**, so the 24 MB ceiling, the
  "similarity disabled for this library" note, and the in-browser f16 decoder
  and dot product are gone. This is what the 0.20.2 entry below said the real
  fix would be.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **The install docs now cover upgrading**, which they never mentioned. Re-run
  the same command; it overwrites the binary in place and touches nothing else.
  They also say plainly that nothing will tell you a new release exists, since
  the script does not check and videre does not phone home.

- **The docs teach the short `videre.sh/install` address** rather than
  `docs.videre.sh/install`. Both serve the same file.

### Fixed

- :warning: **`videre gallery` never finished loading on a large library.** Two
  causes, both of them the page carrying data it should have fetched.

  **Face crops were decoded and inlined.** For every labelled face on every
  file, building the page opened the original and decoded the **whole** image to
  cut out one face. On a library with 23,217 labelled faces across 16,572 files
  that is 16,572 full-resolution JPEG decodes per request, off external storage.
  Nothing errored; the request simply never returned. A live page now sends the
  face id and the browser fetches the crop from `/api/face-image/` when a
  lightbox opens. Static exports keep inline crops, having no server to ask.

  **Every embedding was inlined as base64**, which was 145 MB of a 149 MB page.
  Above 24 MB of vectors, in-page similarity search is now switched off with a
  note explaining why, the same path already taken for a library with no
  embeddings. Smaller libraries keep it.

  Measured on a real 70,601-file library: **from not returning at all to 28 MB
  in 0.6 seconds**, with every file present.

  Serving the file list itself from an endpoint, rather than inlining 28 MB of
  it, is the remaining step.

- **The docs taught command lines that no longer parse.** `guides/browsing.md`
  still documented `--faces`, `--show-faces`, `--heic` and `--heic-original`,
  including a table explaining how they combined, two releases after they were
  removed. Quickstart and workflows named `--show-faces` too, the tuning guide
  named `--min-samples` for a flag actually called `--min-cluster-size`, and the
  compositional search guide showed a `--sort-order` flag that has never
  existed.

  **The check that should have caught this only read the command reference.** It
  now reads every page.

- **Quickstart never said how to install videre**, while being the home page's
  main call to action. Its first instruction was to run a command the reader did
  not have yet.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **`videre gallery --port 0` announced a port you could not connect to.** Asking
  the OS to pick a free port worked, but the startup line printed the port that
  was *requested* rather than the one bound, so the server reported
  `http://127.0.0.1:0` and `--browse` opened the same dead address.

- **`make coverage` had stopped building at all.** It pinned itself to `stable`
  while everything else moved to the toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`, and a
  dependency began requiring a language feature `stable` did not have yet. The
  test suite stayed green throughout, so nothing surfaced it. Coverage now
  follows the same pin as the build.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-20

### Removed

- :warning: **`videre report` is gone**, as 0.18.0 said it would be. Use
  [`videre gallery`](https://docs.videre.sh/commands/gallery/) to browse the
  library, `videre dedupe --html` to write a duplicate-review page, and
  `videre search ... --html` to write a page of search results.

  Removing it left references behind, now cleaned up. Two were user-visible:
  `videre dedupe` told you to "review with videre report before deleting", and
  the gallery page titled itself **videre report** in the browser tab and its
  own heading.

  Two of its modes have no static equivalent on purpose. `--all` and
  `--by-date` are now routes of `videre gallery`, which is a live server,
  because in-page similarity search needs a backend that an exported file
  cannot have.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **An install script**, so videre can be installed without Homebrew and
  without a Rust toolchain:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://docs.videre.sh/install | sh
  ```

  It works out your platform, verifies the download against the `.sha256`
  published with each release **before unpacking it**, and installs to
  `~/.local/bin`. It never edits your shell profile, and it warns when another
  videre earlier on your `PATH` would keep winning.

  `--uninstall` removes the binary it installed and nothing else. Your library
  and the downloaded models are reported with their sizes rather than deleted,
  and a binary belonging to Homebrew or `cargo` is refused with the right
  command named instead.

  This matters most on ARM64 Linux, where building from source needs
  `-C target-feature=+fp16` and a prebuilt binary does not.

- **A Troubleshooting page**, organised by the symptom you see rather than by
  which command produced it: an old copy on your `PATH` winning, search
  returning nothing, files skipped on a slow drive, HEIC skipped on Linux, a
  command waiting on the writer lock, and resuming an interrupted job.

### Changed

- **Cautions moved from "Start here" to Reference.** It warns about commands you
  have not run yet, which is not a thing to read before starting. The old
  address redirects.

### Fixed

- **`videre --help` still advertised the deprecated `report` command.** Its
  first line described videre as doing "reports over one SQLite database". It
  now says "browsing", which covers `gallery` and the `--html` exports without
  naming a command that can move again.

- **`videre gallery` was missing from the documentation sidebar**, so the
  command added in 0.18.0 had a page that nothing linked to, while the
  deprecated `videre report` it replaced was still listed. The two have swapped
  places; report's page is still reachable by address.

- **Two sections of this changelog were both headed `Unreleased`**, and the
  0.18.0 release renamed both. The older one, five `videre import` fixes, was
  written for 0.13.0 and never filed under it, so it briefly appeared as part
  of 0.18.0. It is back under 0.13.0 where it belongs.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **`videre gallery`**, one local server for browsing your library, with every
  view on its own route: `/` for all files, `/people` for face groups, `/date`
  for a Year/Month/Day drill-down. They link to each other, so a face in the
  gallery is clickable through to that person's page. `--browse` opens it,
  `--port` moves it off 7878.
- **`videre dedupe --html`** and **`videre search --html`** write the set a
  command just produced to a browsable page you can keep, archive or send.

### Changed

- :warning: **`videre report` is deprecated** and will be removed in the next
  release. It still works, is hidden from `--help`, and prints the replacement
  for whatever you asked it to do. `--all`, `--faces`, `--by-date` and
  `--show-faces` become routes of `videre gallery`; plain `videre report`
  becomes `videre dedupe --html`.

  `--heic` and `--heic-original` have no equivalent and are not missed: a
  server converts HEIC on demand, and eager embedding existed only because a
  file written to disk cannot ask for a thumbnail later.

- **Sizes at or above a terabyte now say TB.** Byte formatting had three
  implementations that disagreed, two of which stopped at GB, so a 2 TB library
  rendered as "2048.0 GB". `videre stats` used two of the three in one output.

### Fixed

- **`search --json` described most queries as date queries.** Anything filtered
  only by `--type`, `--ext`, `--mime` or `--path` reported
  `{"kind": "date", "value": ".."}`, because "date" was the unconditional
  fall-through when no text, image, person, category or location was given. It
  now reports `kind: "filter"` and names every active filter. This is the
  description an agent reads over MCP to understand its own request.

- **`videre report --by-date` produced a different file on every run** over an
  unchanged database. Grouping discarded the query's ordering.

### Internal

- The HTML, CSS and JavaScript left Rust string literals for real files rendered
  with Askama, checked against their structs at compile time.
  `commands/report.rs` went from 3,494 lines to about 2,200, and output stayed
  byte-identical throughout.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-19

### Removed

- :warning: **A person's identity can no longer be changed, by design.** The
  name in `/person/<name>` and in every face row is permanent. What a person is
  *shown* as stays editable, which is what the two fields were separated for:
  correcting a spelling or adding a surname changes nothing else and breaks no
  links.

  **Breaking for anyone using `videre-api` as a library**: `rename_person` and
  the `Error::Conflict` variant are gone. `set_full_name` covers the display
  rename, and nothing else constructed `Conflict`. The `/api/rename-person`
  endpoint has been removed with them; no page ever called it.

  To correct an identity, delete the person and relabel.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **`videre import` is now mentioned where people look for it.** It brings in a
  Google Takeout export, an Apple Photos library, or a Lightroom catalog,
  originals rather than derivatives and with dates put back. It was missing from
  the README's feature list, from the README's command list, and from the
  documentation home page entirely.
- The home page now says plainly that search needs no keywording, and that a
  library spread across external drives is ordinary: `videre prune` tells an
  unplugged drive from deleted photos and leaves those rows alone.

Documentation only. No behaviour changed.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **`alice` and `Alice` were two different people.** A different capitalisation
  silently split someone in two, so person search returned half their photos
  with nothing on screen to explain it. A person now has an identity that
  ignores case, accents and spacing, and a separate display name that keeps
  exactly what you typed. `--person alice`, `--person Alice` and
  `--person "Ahmet Arı"` all find the same person.

  **Existing libraries are migrated automatically** the first time a command
  that writes faces runs, keeping your original spelling as the display name.
  Nothing is lost, and names that differed only in case are merged into one
  person.

### Added

- **The labeling UI says when a name will join an existing person**, instead of
  merging silently. Typing a name that already exists now shows
  `adds to Ahmet Arı, 247 face(s)` and the button reads `Add to Ahmet Arı`. The
  New Person box also gained the autocomplete the other name boxes already had.

- **A person's display name can be edited** without changing their identity, so
  adding a surname does not break the URL or touch a single photo.

## [0.15.10] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **`videre stats` now reports what videre is using on disk**, largest first,
  marking which stores are safe to delete because they rebuild. Thumbnails and
  place names regenerate; the database and embeddings do not.
- **`videre stats` now shows what the library is made of**, by file extension
  with the mime type alongside. These are the values `--ext` and `--mime` take.

### Changed

- **Durations are readable.** `stats` printed raw milliseconds, so a run of an
  hour and a half showed as `5412000ms`. Elapsed times across `stats`, `embed`,
  `classify` and `faces` now read `2h 14m`, `41s`, `3.2s`, `840ms`.

### Fixed

- Embeddings are counted per library rather than per home. Other libraries
  sharing a `VIDERE_HOME` are reported separately instead of being added to
  whichever one you asked about.

## [0.15.9] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **The face-labeling UI reshuffled its lists on every reload.** People and
  unassigned clusters came back in a different arbitrary order each time the
  page fetched them, so after assigning one cluster the next one you had lined
  up had moved, and so had the person you were dragging it onto. People are now
  ordered by name, and clusters largest first.

## [0.15.8] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Two different people could end up in one face group.** After clustering,
  videre merges groups whose average embeddings point in a similar direction,
  and that test alone is too weak: two tight groups that sit far apart can still
  have similar averages. Merging now also requires the groups to be close
  overall. On a real library this separated every mixed group among the fourteen
  largest, at the default settings, and left all labels intact.

- **`videre faces --help` described `--merge-sim` backwards.** It said `0 =
  identical direction required`; 0 in fact merges everything into one group.
  Read literally it sent you the wrong way when two people had merged. The docs
  page always had this right.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **`embed`, `classify` and `faces` now word their progress and "nothing to do"
  lines the same way.** All three previously counted different things in
  different words - "pending file(s)", "pending hash(es)", "eligible file(s)" -
  for what is one idea; they all say `pending item(s)` now. If you grep videre's
  stderr in a script, this is the change that affects you.

### Internal

- The three commands share one implementation of "work out what is pending,
  narrow it by the selection, and stop if nothing is left". The model load now
  sits inside that shared path, so a command cannot reach it with nothing to
  process. A wrong copy of that guard is what let a unit test download 778MB of
  model weights.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **A city's administrative sector could be named instead of the city.** A
  Bucharest cluster was labelled `Sector 1, RO`. GeoNames lists such numbered
  slices as populated places, and one can sit closer to your photos than the
  city's own entry. Twelve of them are now excluded, so that cluster reads
  `Bucharest, RO`. Requires a `videre locations` re-run to take effect.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Place names lost their accents: `Üsküdar, TR` appeared as `UEskuedar, TR`.**
  The offline reverse geocoder read GeoNames' `asciiname` column, which is ASCII
  by definition and expands umlauts German-style. videre now ships its own
  GeoNames extract built from the real `name` column, so `Üsküdar`, `Malmö` and
  `Hôtel-de-Ville` come out as written. 21% of the 170,761 place names in the
  dataset contain a non-ASCII character, so this affects far more than one
  language.

  Existing libraries keep the old names until `videre locations` is re-run:
  location names are resolved when they are written, not when they are shown.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **`videre locations` took seven minutes and looked frozen.** The recompute
  runs one UPDATE per distinct coordinate, and that UPDATE matched
  `ROUND(gps_lat, 6) = ROUND(?, 6)` - a function call on a column, so no index
  could be used, and there was no index on the GPS columns anyway. Each of
  26,744 updates scanned all 70,601 rows. It now matches exactly against a new
  index: **412s to 86s** on that library.

- **Location `photo_count` counted some photos twice.** The same `ROUND`
  over-matched, so two coordinates differing past the sixth decimal both
  claimed the same photo. 181 photos were double-counted on a real library,
  179 of them in one city.

### Changed

- **`videre locations` reports progress.** It previously printed nothing until
  the final list, which for a multi-minute recompute is indistinguishable from
  a hang. Both slow phases now report: the distance matrix build (which at
  26,744 coordinates allocates ~5.3GB before any work) and the per-coordinate
  assignment. Suppressed under `--silent`, `--json` and `--geojson`.

- Progress output counts what a command actually processes. The non-TTY line
  said "images processed" for every command, including ones counting
  coordinates.

### Internal

- Dependencies are now optimized in dev and test builds. `cargo test` is a
  debug build, where one CPU inference pass measured 9.41s against 0.168s in
  release; a CPU batch-correctness test consequently ran for 28 minutes on CI.
  Workspace crates stay unoptimized and keep compiling quickly.

- The argument-robustness tests no longer download model weights (777MB) as a
  side effect of exercising `videre embed`.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **`videre scan --output <directory>` scanned the wrong library.** `--output`
  takes an optional value, so `videre scan --output ~/Photos` bound `~/Photos`
  as the output *file* and left the directory unset, which then fell back to the
  configured `default_path`. The scan ran end to end against a different library
  and only the final write failed.

  The severity is the near-miss: had the swallowed path been an existing *file*
  rather than a directory, the write would have **succeeded**, putting one
  library's records into it with no error at all. It now fails before walking
  anything, with a message naming both the cause and the fix.

### Testing

- **An argument-robustness sweep** across all fifteen subcommands: unknown
  flags, flags a command cannot answer, conflicting pairs, degenerate values,
  hostile strings and odd-but-harmless input. It asserts the weakest useful
  property - no panic, ever - rather than pinning messages, and separately
  asserts the library survives SQL-shaped input, which a `format!`-built query
  would fail while passing everything else.

  72 nonsense invocations were run by hand first: zero panics, zero hangs, and
  the database intact after every injection attempt.

- **Coverage on the two least-tested commands.** `classify.rs` 4.7% -> 78.9%,
  `watch.rs` 7.5% -> 38.2%, workspace 82.5% -> 83.8%. Both are where the
  selection layer was wired in most recently, so the newest logic had been
  sitting in the least-tested files.

- `--mime` had no coverage anywhere in the suite and `--path` had one use; both
  are axes 0.15.0 added, and both bugs that shipped in that release were here.

### Changed

- `make test` now passes `--no-fail-fast`, matching CI. Without it one failing
  test binary hides every later one, so `make verify` was no longer "what CI
  gates on".

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **`--model` with a malformed id panicked instead of erroring.**
  `videre embed --model foo` aborted with `thread 'main' panicked ... model id
  is owner/name`. A validator existed but lived in the `config` command and so
  guarded only `videre config set`; the flag reached the loader's `expect`
  directly. An invariant enforced on one of two entrances to the same function
  is not enforced.

  Validation now lives in `videre-core` beside the resolver, so both the flag
  and a hand-edited `config.toml` go through it, and `--model` is additionally
  checked when the argument is parsed - a typo now fails immediately rather than
  after an unrelated "no database found".

- **`videre faces --batch 0` panicked.** It reached `slice::chunks(0)`. `embed`
  had guarded exactly this and `faces` had not, so the guard moved next to
  `MAX_SAFE_BATCH` where both commands reach it. The upper cap stays specific to
  embedding: it exists because that inference path silently corrupts embeddings
  above roughly 121, which is not a fact about face detection, so `faces` takes
  the zero-guard only.

- **The read-timeout handler could hang on the drive it was reporting about.**
  After a timeout, `hash_file` called `std::fs::metadata` **unbounded** on the
  same path, purely to name the timeout in its message. On a stale mount that is
  the call that never returns, so the error path blocked in precisely the
  scenario the timeout exists to survive.

  The applied timeout now comes back with the failure, so the message needs no
  filesystem access. It also names the phase: a dead drive reports that the
  `stat` never answered, rather than claiming a read took 20 seconds when
  nothing was ever read.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-13

### Documentation

- **The scoping filters are documented on the pages people actually read.**
  0.15.0 added `--type`, `--ext`, `--mime` and `--path` to `videre search`, but
  neither the search page nor the compositional-search guide mentioned them, so
  the four newest filters were discoverable only from `--help`.

- Worked, end-to-end examples for composing filters: staging a large library
  through `embed` in slices, bounding `faces` to one trip, re-labelling a single
  folder with `classify`, and watching only an inbox. Every example in the docs
  was verified to parse against the real binary.

### Fixed

- Two compiler warnings that only ever appeared during `cargo publish`, which is
  the one build in the pipeline that compiles from a clean target directory and
  so re-emits what a cached local build stays silent about. `apply_location` in
  `search.rs` was left unused when the selection layer took over location
  filtering; a closure in `selection.rs` was needlessly `mut`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Scoping filters on the long-running commands.** `videre embed`, `faces`,
  `classify`, `scan` and `watch` now take the same filter flags `videre search`
  has, so a run can cover part of a library instead of all of it: `videre embed
  --type video`, `videre faces --date 2024-07`, `videre scan ~/Photos --path
  ~/Photos/2024`. On a large library this is the difference between an
  afternoon and a few minutes.

  `--type`, `--ext` and `--mime` are repeatable and accept comma-separated
  lists. Combining flags narrows further: every condition must hold.

- **`videre search` gained `--type`, `--ext`, `--mime` and `--path`**, the same
  four the walk-based commands take, and the MCP `search` tool gained the
  matching parameters so an agent can ask for them too.

- **A [scoping guide](https://docs.videre.sh/guides/scoping-a-run/)** covering
  the shared vocabulary, which commands accept which flags and why the gaps
  exist, and the rule that a file missing the data a filter needs is excluded
  rather than assumed.

### Changed

- **Every filter now lives in one place** (`videre_core::selection`) rather than
  being reimplemented per command. `search` and the MCP server already shared
  their predicates; that sharing now extends to every command that filters, so
  a fix to a predicate reaches all of them at once.

- **A scoped run reports what it passed over**, as `412 of 70,601`. A filter
  that matches nothing is not an error, so without the denominator a wrong
  filter and an empty library look identical.

- **`videre search` reports truncation.** Showing 20 results out of thousands
  with nothing to say so was indistinguishable from having found only 20. The
  JSON output gained `total_matches`.

### Fixed

- **`--path` under a symlink matched nothing, on both surfaces.** Each root was
  replaced by its canonical form while the other side of the comparison was not
  canonicalised: the walk yields paths rooted where the user pointed it, and a
  stored row holds whatever path the scan recorded. So `--path` under a
  symlinked directory silently selected nothing and reported success. On Linux
  that included `/lib`, which resolves to `/usr/lib`; on macOS, anything under
  `/tmp` or `/var`.

  Both forms of each root are now matched, from one shared helper, so the walk
  side and the row side cannot drift apart again. Per-row canonicalisation would
  cost a stat per row and is deliberately not done.

### Notes

- `videre locations` deliberately takes no filters. It rebuilds every cluster
  from scratch per run, so a scoped run would not do less work, it would leave
  everything outside the scope unclustered.
- `videre embed` and `videre faces` deliberately omit `--person` and
  `--category`. Both are derived from the data those commands produce, so
  selecting their input by one is circular.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **`VIDERE_HOME` now outranks a config file's `default_db`.** Setting
  `VIDERE_HOME` and then having the run write to a different database was
  possible, and did happen: a scan aimed at one home wrote 70,601 records into
  another, because that home's `config.toml` named an absolute `default_db`.

  Environment variables are expected to beat persisted settings, and this one
  did not. The effect was worse than a surprise, because it silently defeats the
  isolation `VIDERE_HOME` exists to provide: a copied home carries the
  original's absolute path, so pointing `VIDERE_HOME` at a copy still wrote into
  the source.

  Precedence is now `--db` > `VIDERE_HOME` > `config.toml` > built-in default.
  When the environment variable and the config disagree, videre says which it is
  using rather than choosing silently, so a deliberate `default_db` is not
  quietly ignored either.

  Nothing changes for anyone not setting `VIDERE_HOME`: `videre config set db`
  behaves exactly as before.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Video now carries dates, locations, dimensions, duration and codec.**
  Until now videre read no metadata from video at all: the extractor covered
  jpeg, tiff and heic only, so every `.mov` and `.mp4` was stored with no date
  and no coordinates. Measured on a real library, that was **13,457 videos, 0
  dates, 0 GPS**.

  The effect was wider than two empty columns. Every feature keyed on date or
  place silently excluded video - `--after`/`--before`, `--near`,
  `videre locations` and any query combining them - which on that library meant
  19% of the files were missing from results that presented themselves as
  covering the whole library, with nothing to indicate it.

  Parsing is in-house, walking the container's boxes the way the existing video
  probe already does, so there is no new dependency and no external process.

  Two new columns, `duration_secs` and `codec`. They are added in the same
  release deliberately: existing rows cannot pick any of this up incrementally,
  since `--retry-incomplete` looks for rows with no recorded type and these are
  not that, so one full re-scan is needed either way. Adding them later would
  have required a second one.

  :warning: **Libraries scanned before this release need `videre scan` run
  again** to populate the new fields.

### Notes

- Dates from video are stored as **local wall-clock time**, matching how photo
  dates are stored, so the two sort and filter together. Apple's containers
  record both a local time and a UTC one; the local is preferred, and the UTC
  fallback is used only for files carrying nothing else (10 of 260 on the test
  corpus, all re-encoded renders rather than camera originals).
- Verified against `ffprobe` on 260 real videos: **0 mismatches** across date,
  coordinates and duration.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Large files are no longer skipped as "unreachable".** `videre scan` bounded
  every file read with a flat 20-second timeout, so a big file on a healthy
  drive was indistinguishable from a hung one and was dropped with a message
  blaming the drive. Measured on a real library: a 3.7 GB video on a drive
  sustaining 158 MB/s needs about 23 seconds to read. File sizes do not change,
  so the same files were skipped on every run, and they are by definition the
  longest videos in a library. No row was written at all, so they were simply
  absent from the database.

  The read timeout now scales with file size, never dropping below the previous
  20 seconds, so small files are unaffected. The `stat` that reads the size is
  bounded separately by a short constant, and that ordering is the safety
  property: a disconnected or stale mount still fails there in about five
  seconds and the read is never attempted, so a large file on a dead mount
  cannot hang for its scaled timeout.

  This applies to whole-file reads only. Decoding is left alone: a QuickLook
  poster frame reads a fraction of a video, so scaling by full file size would
  turn a known QuickLook hang from 20 seconds into minutes.

### Added

- **`videre config set read-rate <MB/s>`**, the assumed floor read rate used to
  scale that timeout. Defaults to 20 MB/s, which is far under real hardware and
  only worth changing for a slower mount. Zero is rejected: as a read rate it
  means an unbounded timeout, which is the hang the mechanism exists to prevent.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- **`videre scan --similar` now computes perceptual hashes in parallel, and
  shows progress while it does.** The pass ran single-threaded with no output,
  so on a large library it was a long silence indistinguishable from a hang.
  Measured on 700 real files (300 HEIC, 300 JPEG, 60 MOV, 40 PNG, 2.3 GB) on a
  10-core machine: **108s to 15s**. Expect less on an external drive, where
  reading the files rather than decoding them becomes the limit.

  The hashing pass above it was already parallel; only this one was not. It
  became far more noticeable in 0.13.0, when HEIC started taking the QuickLook
  path and joined video in paying a conversion per file.

  Hashes and their order are unchanged: verified end to end on real HEIC and
  video, where the parallel and serial runs produced identical values for all
  700 files.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **`videre import`**, bringing photos in from another tool. Point it at a
  folder, a library package, or an export and it works out the rest:

  ```bash
  videre import ~/Pictures        # find whatever is in there
  videre import ~/Takeout         # a Google Takeout export
  videre import                   # search the usual places
  ```

- **Google Takeout.** Restores the capture dates Takeout leaves in `.json`
  sidecars rather than in the files. Handles Google's truncated sidecar names
  (`photo.jpg.supplemental-metadata.json` arriving as `photo.jpg.s.json`), `(1)`
  duplicate counters, and `-edited` versions. Uses `photoTakenTime`, never
  `creationTime`, which is the upload date and the most common way other tools
  get this wrong. An ambiguous name applies no date at all, since a wrong date is
  worse than a missing one.

- **Apple Photos and iPhoto.** Reads `originals/`, `Masters/` or `Originals/`
  directly, covering all three layouts Apple has used. Prints a pre-flight
  checklist first, led by "Download Originals to this Mac", because importing
  iCloud placeholders as though they were originals is the one failure here that
  destroys data. Warns when the library's median file size suggests optimised
  storage, and detects a referenced library.

- **Adobe Lightroom.** Reads `.lrcat` to find which folders hold the photos,
  which is the one thing a filesystem scan cannot tell you. The catalog is copied
  before reading, never opened in place. Root folders on disconnected drives are
  reported as offline rather than treated as missing files.

- **A shared location contract** in `videre-core`, used by every source: an
  optional provider database, then known folder layouts, then asking the user.
  The default never opens a provider database. `--originals <dir>` overrides
  every step, so the feature keeps working by hand on the day a vendor changes
  their structure rather than after videre ships a fix. Each run reports which
  step found the files.

### Notes

- Import modifies file timestamps, like `fix-dates`, so it asks for confirmation
  and supports `--dry-run`. Only the modification time changes.
- Import comes **before** `scan`, since dates must be corrected before `scan`
  records them.
- `--into`, for copying into a clean destination tree, is accepted but not yet
  implemented; it exits with a message rather than being silently ignored.

### Fixed

Found by running `videre import` against a real 36GB Google Takeout export and
a real Photos library, rather than against fixtures.

- **Takeout detection missed `Google Photos/`**, the folder people are most
  likely to point at. A real export keeps only album directories there, with
  the sidecars one level inside them, so probing the immediate directory alone
  reported a genuine export as ordinary photos. Detection now looks one level
  down, bounded so it stays a recognition step rather than a deep walk.

- **A permission failure was reported as a missing library.** Layout probing
  goes through `Path::is_dir`, which answers false for "blocked" exactly as it
  does for "absent", so a macOS-protected `.photoslibrary` produced advice
  about Apple changing their structure. It now names Full Disk Access and the
  need to restart the program, which is the actual fix.

- **An empty `originals/` was asserted to be a referenced library.** On disk
  that is indistinguishable from one whose originals iCloud has evicted,
  including when iCloud was switched off with "Remove from Mac". Photos keeps
  displaying every picture from the previews it retained, so nothing looks
  wrong until an original is needed. Both causes are now offered, the one that
  loses data first.

- **A kept-originals backup was not detected at all.** Apple detection required
  `database/Photos.sqlite` beside the originals, so a backup where only
  `originals/` was copied off a library went unrecognised. The `0`-`F` hex
  fan-out is the signature that survives such a copy, and is specific enough
  not to fire on an ordinary folder that merely happens to be called
  `originals`.

- **`videre scan --similar` computed no perceptual hash for HEIC**, silently
  skipping the default iPhone format in near-duplicate detection. `PHASH_MIMES`
  omitted `image/heic` and the underlying `image` crate cannot decode it. HEIC
  now converts through QuickLook exactly as video already did, asking for a
  64px rendition since the hash resizes to 9x8 - measured at 3 seconds per 20
  files against 2 for JPEG. macOS-only, as QuickLook is.


## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **`videre search` filters now compose.** `--person`, `--category`, `--location`
  and the new date bounds can be combined freely; each narrows the result set,
  and a text query or `--image` ranks whatever survives. Previously exactly one
  mode could be used per invocation.
- **Date filtering.** `--after` (inclusive) and `--before` (exclusive), or the
  `--date` shorthand accepting `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MM-DD`. Adjacent ranges
  tile without both claiming the boundary instant.
- **`--sort`**, taking a comma-separated `field[:asc|desc]` list over
  `relevance`, `distance`, `date` and `size`. Later fields break ties in earlier
  ones, so `--sort=distance,date` means nearest first and newest first among
  files at the same place. Directions are optional; each field defaults to what
  is usually meant.
- **The MCP `search` tool exposes all of it**, under the same names. The CLI and
  the MCP server now run the identical code path, so results cannot diverge.
- Search results carry the effective date, so a caller can see why a file
  matched.

### Changed

- **`-k` now applies to `--person` and `--category`.** Those modes previously
  returned every match, unordered. They are now truncated like any other search
  and ordered deterministically. Pass a large `-k` for the full set.
- **The MCP `search` tool's rule changed** from "exactly one of query, person or
  image_path" to "at most one ranker, plus any filters, at least one of
  something". Existing single-parameter calls keep working.
- Asking for a sort whose input is absent is now an error rather than a silent
  fallback: `--sort relevance` needs a query or `--image`, `--sort distance`
  needs `--location`.

### Notes

Dates match the EXIF capture date when a file has one, and its modification time
otherwise, so files without EXIF (screenshots, most videos) stay reachable by
date. The trade-off is that results can mix "when taken" with "when the file was
last written"; running `videre fix-dates` makes the two agree.


## [0.11.5] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Prebuilt binaries.** Releases now ship ready-to-run archives, so installing
  no longer needs a Rust toolchain or a long compile:

  | platform | archive |
  |---|---|
  | Apple Silicon Mac | `aarch64-apple-darwin` (21 MB) |
  | Linux x86_64 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (23 MB) |
  | Linux ARM64 | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (24 MB) |

  Each has a `.sha256` alongside. Every archive is downloaded onto a clean
  machine and actually run before the release is published, so a binary that
  only works where it was built cannot ship.

### Changed

- The README now leads with the binary download, and notes the macOS Gatekeeper
  quarantine on browser downloads.

### Known limitation

- **Intel Macs are not supported.** The ONNX Runtime dependency ships no
  prebuilt binaries for `x86_64-apple-darwin`, so videre cannot be built for
  that target at all, including via `cargo install`. This was not introduced
  here; it has been true for as long as ONNX Runtime has been a dependency, and
  setting up release builds is simply what surfaced it.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Documentation corrections.** No code changes; released so the corrected
  README reaches crates.io.
  - The first `videre embed` downloads about **780 MB**, not the 1.4 GB the
    README claimed. That figure was `siglip2-base-patch16-384`, which stopped
    being the default in 0.10.0. `videre faces` downloads a separate 180 MB.
  - Stated explicitly that model downloads are **lazy and per-command**:
    `scan`, `dedupe`, `fix-dates`, `prune`, `stats` and `locations` need no
    model at all.
  - The README now documents `videre prune`'s safety guards, added in 0.11.2
    but never described there: a disconnected drive is left alone,
    `--prune-unreachable` overrides it, and a cleanup removing more than 20%
    of the library stops unless forced.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **`videre scan` and `videre watch` now take `--db`**, the same flag every
  other subcommand uses. `--output-sqlite` still works as an alias, so existing
  scripts are unaffected.

  It was called `--output-sqlite` for historical reasons: `scan` predates the
  readers, from when JSONL and SQLite were peer output *formats* rather than one
  destination and one opt-out. `videre scan --db` failing was surprising every
  time.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`videre prune` no longer deletes your library when a drive is
  disconnected.** It treated every "cannot read this file" as "this file was
  deleted", so pruning with an external drive unplugged removed every row for
  that drive. The rows were the cheap part: their embeddings and cached
  thumbnails were then swept as orphans, which is hours of recompute against
  minutes to re-scan rows. `videre watch --prune` runs the same code unattended
  on a loop.

  A row is now removed only when the file is missing **and its parent directory
  still exists**. A missing parent means the folder or the whole volume is gone,
  so the rows are kept and reported. Pass `--prune-unreachable` when a folder
  really is gone for good.

### Added

- **`videre prune` stops before an implausibly large deletion.** A run removing
  more than 20% of the library and at least 100 rows now refuses and changes
  nothing, so a volume that remounts empty cannot quietly empty the database.
  `--force` proceeds anyway.
- **`videre prune` gives up after 10 consecutive errors** instead of printing
  one near-identical line per row, reporting the first error verbatim. Earlier
  changes stay committed and prune is idempotent, so it is safe to re-run once
  the cause is fixed.
- Skipped rows are reported **even with `--silent`**, naming the missing
  directories, since a run that quietly skips thousands of rows is the problem
  this release exists to fix.

`videre watch --prune` can override neither guard: it runs unattended and cannot
ask.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **`videre scan --retry-incomplete`** processes only files a previous scan did
  not finish, instead of re-reading the whole library. A full scan of a 70,601
  file library reads roughly 460GB and takes about 10 minutes, so filling a
  handful of stragglers no longer costs a full pass.

### Changed

- A file whose bytes match no known signature now records
  `application/octet-stream` instead of an empty type, so it is not re-read on
  every retry. This does not change how such files are decoded.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **`videre scan` records each file's real type** in a new `file_hashes.mime`
  column, detected from its magic bytes rather than its filename. Costs no
  extra reading: the bytes are already in memory for hashing. Existing
  libraries gain the column automatically and fill it on the next scan.

### Changed

- **Removed the pre-0.10 fallback that read embeddings from the main
  database.** It was always scheduled for this release. An unmigrated 0.9.x
  library now gets the same clear error as any other missing model, naming
  what does exist and the command to run. Nothing is deleted; the old rows sit
  untouched and can be dropped by hand.

### Fixed

- **Misnamed files are decoded by their real type.** A JPEG named `.png`
  previously failed every `videre embed` run with "Invalid PNG signature"; it
  now embeds correctly. Decoding, perceptual hashing, EXIF extraction, and the
  photo/video split all route on content rather than filename.
- **A partly-created per-model embedding database is repaired** rather than
  attached broken forever. Previously an initialisation cut short by a crash
  or a full disk left a file that every later run skipped, failing with "no
  such table".

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Videos with no video track no longer cost 20 seconds each.** `qlmanage`
  hangs rather than failing on such a file, so `videre embed` and
  `videre scan --similar` waited out the full timeout on every run, forever.
  They are now detected and skipped instantly. Measured on a 70,601-file
  library: 60 seconds saved per `embed` run and the same per `scan --similar`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- `--model <id>` on `embed`, `search`, `classify`, `report`, and `mcp`, so
  several embedding models can be used against one library and compared.
  Resolution order is `--model`, then `default_model` in `config.toml`, then
  the built-in default.
- `videre config set model <id>` persists a default embedding model, alongside
  the existing `db` and `path` keys.
- `videre stats` reports embeddings per model: count, dimensions, and file
  size. The `--json` output gains a matching `embeddings` array; existing
  fields are unchanged and `schema_version` stays `1`.

### Changed

- **The default search model is now `google/siglip-base-patch16-224`**, about
  twice as fast as the previous default. Each model keeps its own data, so this
  leaves any existing model's vectors intact and reachable with `--model`.
- **`VIDERE_EMBED_MODEL` has been removed.** Use `videre config set model <id>`
  for a lasting default or `--model <id>` for one command. Configuration
  belongs in `config.toml`, not the environment.
- **Embeddings moved out of the main database** into one SQLite file per model
  per library, under `~/.videre/embeddings/`. Vectors were roughly three
  quarters of a real 427 MB library, and a single shared table allowed only one
  model to be usable at a time.
- `videre prune` now sweeps orphan embeddings across every model database and
  reports its counts per model.
- `classifications` is keyed by `(model_id, hash)` rather than `hash` alone.
  This also fixes a real bug: any hash already classified was skipped for every
  model, so a second model would classify nothing while reporting success. A
  table predating this change is reset, with a note; rebuilding it is minutes
  of vector arithmetic with no image decoding.

### Upgrading

**If you embedded on 0.9.23 or later, run one command before searching:**

```bash
videre config set model google/siglip2-base-patch16-384
```

Embeddings still in your main database are read as before, but only for the
model that produced them, and the default model changed in this release. Your
existing vectors are tagged `siglip2-base-patch16-384`, so without that setting
a search asks for `siglip-base-patch16-224` and finds nothing. `videre search`
tells you so rather than returning an empty result quietly.

Alternatively, run `videre embed` to build the new default's vectors, which
takes roughly an hour for 70,000 photos. Either way, nothing is lost or
overwritten: models keep separate data.

The read fallback for pre-0.10 embeddings is removed in 0.11.0.

If you depend on these crates as libraries rather than using the CLI, note that
`videre-core`'s `ensure_embeddings_table` is gone, `insert_classifications` and
`paths_for_category` take a `model_id`, `resolve_model_id` returns
`anyhow::Result<String>` rather than `String` so a malformed `config.toml` is
an error rather than a silent fallback, and `videre-ml`'s `Embedder::load`
takes the model id explicitly instead of reading it from the environment.

## [0.9.29] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Removed dashes used as punctuation throughout code comments and docs.

## [0.9.28] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Per-command reference in the README covering every flag.

## [0.9.27] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Restored a plain-language "Why videre" section to the README and folded the
  technical detail into `CLAUDE.md`.

## [0.9.26] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Rewrote the README for readers who are not Rust developers.

## [0.9.25] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Environment variables promoted to a top-level README section.

## [0.9.24] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Documented `VIDERE_EMBED_MODEL` and `VIDERE_EMBED_DTYPE`.

## [0.9.23] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- **Default embedding model is now `google/siglip2-base-patch16-384`**, 3.6x
  faster than the previous `siglip-so400m-patch14-384`: 131ms per photo against
  479ms, taking a 70,000 photo library from roughly 9.4 hours to 2.6. A blind
  comparison of 14 searches showed no quality advantage for the slower model.

  Embeddings are tagged with the model that produced them, so this invalidates
  existing ones and requires a full re-run of `videre embed`. Set
  `VIDERE_EMBED_MODEL=google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384` to stay on the old
  model.

## [0.9.22] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- `VIDERE_EMBED_DTYPE=f16` for half-precision inference, roughly 7% faster on a
  realistic mix. Opt-in, with no measurable quality change.

## [0.9.21] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **`videre embed --batch` is capped at 96.** Above a threshold measured
  between 121 and 127, the batched inference path silently returned embeddings
  that did not match a one-at-a-time baseline: no error, no NaN values, just
  wrong vectors, with only the trailing partial batch correct. Values above the
  cap are reduced with a warning.

## [0.9.20] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Lock files moved from beside the database to `~/.videre/locks/`, keyed by a
  hash of the database's canonical path so two libraries with the same filename
  no longer share a lock. Stale files from the old layout are cleaned up
  automatically on the first run.

## [0.9.19] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- README updates.

## [0.9.18] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Near-duplicate detection for `.mov` and `.mp4` under `scan --similar`, using
  a perceptual hash of the QuickLook poster frame. macOS only; other platforms
  skip it rather than failing.
- First release published to crates.io.
